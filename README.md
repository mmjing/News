| **[Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10337v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing reliability in prediction intervals using point forecasters: Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression and Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14904v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing prediction intervals for time series forecasting is challenging, particularly when practitioners rely solely on point forecasts. While previous research has focused on creating increasingly efficient intervals, we argue that standard measures alone are inadequate. Beyond efficiency, prediction intervals must adapt their width based on the difficulty of the prediction while preserving coverage regardless of complexity. To address these issues, we propose combining Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression (HQR) with Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference (WACI). This integrated procedure guarantees theoretical coverage and enables interval widths to vary with predictive uncertainty. We assess its performance using both a synthetic example and a real world Electricity Price Forecasting scenario. Our results show that this combined approach meets or surpasses typical benchmarks for validity and efficiency, while also fulfilling important yet often overlooked practical requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaceTime: Causal Discovery from Non-Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10235v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causality is challenging and often complicated by changing causal relationships over time and across environments. Climate patterns, for example, shift over time with recurring seasonal trends, while also depending on geographical characteristics such as ecosystem variability. Existing methods for discovering causal graphs from time series either assume stationarity, do not permit both temporal and spatial distribution changes, or are unaware of locations with the same causal relationships. In this work, we therefore unify the three tasks of causal graph discovery in the non-stationary multi-context setting, of reconstructing temporal regimes, and of partitioning datasets and time intervals into those where invariant causal relationships hold. To construct a consistent score that forms the basis of our method, we employ the Minimum Description Length principle. Our resulting algorithm SPACETIME simultaneously accounts for heterogeneity across space and non-stationarity over time. Given multiple time series, it discovers regime changepoints and a temporal causal graph using non-parametric functional modeling and kernelized discrepancy testing. We also show that our method provides insights into real-world phenomena such as river-runoff measured at different catchments and biosphere-atmosphere interactions across ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Relevance of AWS Chronos: An Evaluation of Standard Methods for Time Series Forecasting with Limited Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10216v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A systematic comparison of Chronos, a transformer-based time series forecasting framework, against traditional approaches including ARIMA and Prophet. We evaluate these models across multiple time horizons and user categories, with a focus on the impact of historical context length. Our analysis reveals that while Chronos demonstrates superior performance for longer-term predictions and maintains accuracy with increased context, traditional models show significant degradation as context length increases. We find that prediction quality varies systematically between user classes, suggesting that underlying behavior patterns always influence model performance. This study provides a case for deploying Chronos in real-world applications where limited model tuning is feasible, especially in scenarios requiring longer prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Urban Change Detection from Satellite Image Time Series with Temporal Feature Refinement and Multi-Task Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17458v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urbanization advances at unprecedented rates, resulting in negative effects on the environment and human well-being. Remote sensing has the potential to mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a satellite image time series (SITS). Specifically, we propose a temporal feature refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution SITS acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440). Moreover, our experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Code will be available at https://github.com/SebastianHafner/ContUrbanCD.git</p></details> |
| **[Two-level Solar Irradiance Clustering with Season Identification: A Comparative Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10084v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solar irradiance clustering can enhance solar power capacity planning and help improve forecasting models by identifying similar irradiance patterns influenced by seasonal and weather changes. In this study, we adopt an efficient two-level clustering approach to automatically identify seasons using the clear sky irradiance in first level and subsequently to identify daily cloud level as clear, cloudy and partly cloudy within each season in second level. In the second level of clustering, three methods are compared, namely, Daily Irradiance Index (DII or $\beta$), Euclidean Distance (ED), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. The DII is computed as the ratio of time integral of measured irradiance to time integral of the clear sky irradiance. The identified clusters were compared quantitatively using established clustering metrics and qualitatively by comparing the mean irradiance profiles. The results clearly establish the superiority of the $\beta$-based clustering approach as the leader, setting a new benchmark for solar irradiance clustering studies. Moreover, $\beta$-based clustering remains effective even for annual data unlike the time-series methods which suffer significant performance degradation. Interestingly, contrary to expectations, ED-based clustering outperforms the more compute-intensive DTW distance-based clustering. The method has been rigorously validated using data from two distinct US locations, demonstrating robust scalability for larger datasets and potential applicability for other locations.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Spatiotemporal Prediction of Secondary Crashes by Rebalancing Dynamic and Static Data with Generative Adversarial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10041v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data imbalance is a common issue in analyzing and predicting sudden traffic events. Secondary crashes constitute only a small proportion of all crashes. These secondary crashes, triggered by primary crashes, significantly exacerbate traffic congestion and increase the severity of incidents. However, the severe imbalance of secondary crash data poses significant challenges for prediction models, affecting their generalization ability and prediction accuracy. Existing methods fail to fully address the complexity of traffic crash data, particularly the coexistence of dynamic and static features, and often struggle to effectively handle data samples of varying lengths. Furthermore, most current studies predict the occurrence probability and spatiotemporal distribution of secondary crashes separately, lacking an integrated solution. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid model named VarFusiGAN-Transformer, aimed at improving the fidelity of secondary crash data generation and jointly predicting the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of secondary crashes. The VarFusiGAN-Transformer model employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the generation of multivariate long-time series data, incorporating a static data generator and an auxiliary discriminator to model the joint distribution of dynamic and static features. In addition, the model's prediction module achieves simultaneous prediction of both the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of secondary crashes. Compared to existing methods, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance in generating high-fidelity data and improving prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Graph Representations and Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08305v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) enables the analysis if complex temporal data, and thus serves as a cornerstone in various real-world applications, ranging from healthcare to finance. Since the relationship among variables in MTS usually contain crucial cues, a large number of graph-based MTSC approaches have been proposed, as the graph topology and edges can explicitly represent relationships among variables (channels), where not only various MTS graph representation learning strategies but also different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been explored. Despite such progresses, there is no comprehensive study that fairly benchmarks and investigates the performances of existing widely-used graph representation learning strategies/GNN classifiers in the application of different MTSC tasks. In this paper, we present the first benchmark which systematically investigates the effectiveness of the widely-used three node feature definition strategies, four edge feature learning strategies and five GNN architecture, resulting in 60 different variants for graph-based MTSC. These variants are developed and evaluated with a standardized data pipeline and training/validation/testing strategy on 26 widely-used suspensor MTSC datasets. Our experiments highlight that node features significantly influence MTSC performance, while the visualization of edge features illustrates why adaptive edge learning outperforms other edge feature learning methods. The code of the proposed benchmark is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CVI-yangwn/Benchmark-GNN-for-Multivariate-Time-Series-Classification}.</p></details> |  |
| **[NL2KQL: From Natural Language to Kusto Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02933v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data is growing rapidly in volume and complexity. Proficiency in database query languages is pivotal for crafting effective queries. As coding assistants become more prevalent, there is significant opportunity to enhance database query languages. The Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a widely used query language for large semi-structured data such as logs, telemetries, and time-series for big data analytics platforms. This paper introduces NL2KQL an innovative framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries (NLQs) to KQL queries. The proposed NL2KQL framework includes several key components: Schema Refiner which narrows down the schema to its most pertinent elements; the Few-shot Selector which dynamically selects relevant examples from a few-shot dataset; and the Query Refiner which repairs syntactic and semantic errors in KQL queries. Additionally, this study outlines a method for generating large datasets of synthetic NLQ-KQL pairs which are valid within a specific database contexts. To validate NL2KQL's performance, we utilize an array of online (based on query execution) and offline (based on query parsing) metrics. Through ablation studies, the significance of each framework component is examined, and the datasets used for benchmarking are made publicly available. This work is the first of its kind and is compared with available baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement learning with non-ergodic reward increments: robustness via ergodicity transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11335v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Envisioned application areas for reinforcement learning (RL) include autonomous driving, precision agriculture, and finance, which all require RL agents to make decisions in the real world. A significant challenge hindering the adoption of RL methods in these domains is the non-robustness of conventional algorithms. In particular, the focus of RL is typically on the expected value of the return. The expected value is the average over the statistical ensemble of infinitely many trajectories, which can be uninformative about the performance of the average individual. For instance, when we have a heavy-tailed return distribution, the ensemble average can be dominated by rare extreme events. Consequently, optimizing the expected value can lead to policies that yield exceptionally high returns with a probability that approaches zero but almost surely result in catastrophic outcomes in single long trajectories. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that lets RL agents optimize the long-term performance of individual trajectories. The algorithm enables the agents to learn robust policies, which we show in an instructive example with a heavy-tailed return distribution and standard RL benchmarks. The key element of the algorithm is a transformation that we learn from data. This transformation turns the time series of collected returns into one for whose increments expected value and the average over a long trajectory coincide. Optimizing these increments results in robust policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted final version to appear in the Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Cueless EEG imagined speech for subject identification: dataset and benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09700v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have emerged as a promising modality for biometric identification. While previous studies have explored the use of imagined speech with semantically meaningful words for subject identification, most have relied on additional visual or auditory cues. In this study, we introduce a cueless EEG-based imagined speech paradigm, where subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of prior methods by requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally. The dataset comprises over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions. We assess a variety of classification methods, including traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as time-series foundation models and deep learning architectures specifically designed for EEG classification, such as EEG Conformer and Shallow ConvNet. A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage. Our results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy, reaching 97.93%. These findings highlight the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).</p></details> |  |
| **[On the optimal prediction of extreme events in heavy-tailed time series with applications to solar flare forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11887v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of extreme events in time series is a fundamental problem arising in many financial, scientific, engineering, and other applications. We begin by establishing a general Neyman-Pearson-type characterization of optimal extreme event predictors in terms of density ratios. This yields new insights and several closed-form optimal extreme event predictors for additive models. These results naturally extend to time series, where we study optimal extreme event prediction for both light- and heavy-tailed autoregressive and moving average models. Using a uniform law of large numbers for ergodic time series, we establish the asymptotic optimality of an empirical version of the optimal predictor for autoregressive models. Using multivariate regular variation, we obtain an expression for the optimal extremal precision in heavy-tailed infinite moving averages, which provides theoretical bounds on the ability to predict extremes in this general class of models. We address the important problem of predicting solar flares by applying our theory and methodology to a state-of-the-art time series consisting of solar soft X-ray flux measurements. Our results demonstrate the success and limitations in solar flare forecasting of long-memory autoregressive models and long-range-dependent, heavy-tailed FARIMA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Asymptotic Equivalence of Locally Stationary Processes and Bivariate White Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05751v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a general class of statistical experiments, in which an $n$-dimensional centered Gaussian random variable is observed and its covariance matrix is the parameter of interest. The covariance matrix is assumed to be well-approximable in a linear space of lower dimension $K_n$ with eigenvalues uniformly bounded away from zero and infinity. We prove asymptotic equivalence of this experiment and a class of $K_n$-dimensional Gaussian models with informative expectation in Le Cam's sense when $n$ tends to infinity and $K_n$ is allowed to increase moderately in $n$ at a polynomial rate. For this purpose we derive a new localization technique for non-i.i.d. data and a novel high-dimensional Central Limit Law in total variation distance. These results are key ingredients to show asymptotic equivalence between the experiments of locally stationary Gaussian time series and a bivariate Wiener process with the log spectral density as its drift. Therein a novel class of matrices is introduced which generalizes circulant Toeplitz matrices traditionally used for strictly stationary time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Singular Value Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03619v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous functional data commonly arise in time series and longitudinal studies. To uncover the statistical structures of such data, we propose Functional Singular Value Decomposition (FSVD), a unified framework encompassing various tasks for the analysis of functional data with potential heterogeneity. We establish the mathematical foundation of FSVD by proving its existence and providing its fundamental properties. We then develop an implementation approach for noisy and irregularly observed functional data based on a novel alternating minimization scheme and provide theoretical guarantees for its convergence and estimation accuracy. The FSVD framework also introduces the concepts of intrinsic basis functions and intrinsic basis vectors, representing two fundamental structural aspects of random functions. These concepts enable FSVD to provide new and improved solutions to tasks including functional principal component analysis, factor models, functional clustering, functional linear regression, and functional completion, while effectively handling heterogeneity and irregular temporal sampling. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that FSVD-based methods consistently outperform existing methods across these tasks. To showcase the value of FSVD in real-world datasets, we apply it to extract temporal patterns from a COVID-19 case count dataset and perform data completion on an electronic health record dataset.</p></details> | New contents added |
| **[AALF: Almost Always Linear Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10142v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works for time-series forecasting more and more leverage the high predictive power of Deep Learning models. With this increase in model complexity, however, comes a lack in understanding of the underlying model decision process, which is problematic for high-stakes application scenarios. At the same time, simple, interpretable forecasting methods such as ARIMA still perform very well, sometimes on-par, with Deep Learning approaches. We argue that simple models are good enough most of the time, and that forecasting performance could be improved by choosing a Deep Learning method only for few, important predictions, increasing the overall interpretability of the forecasting process. In this context, we propose a novel online model selection framework which learns to identify these predictions. An extensive empirical study on various real-world datasets shows that our selection methodology performs comparable to state-of-the-art online model selections methods in most cases while being significantly more interpretable. We find that almost always choosing a simple autoregressive linear model for forecasting results in competitive performance, suggesting that the need for opaque black-box models in time-series forecasting might be smaller than recent works would suggest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Socially Responsible Forecasting: Identifying and Typifying Forecasting Harms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16531v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven organizations around the world routinely use forecasting methods to improve their planning and decision-making capabilities. Although much research exists on the harms resulting from traditional machine learning applications, little has specifically focused on the ethical impact of time series forecasting. Yet forecasting raises unique ethical issues due to the way it is used in different organizational contexts, supports different goals, and involves different data processing, model development, and evaluation pipelines. These differences make it difficult to apply machine learning harm taxonomies to common forecasting contexts. We leverage multiple interviews with expert industry practitioners and academic researchers to remedy this knowledge gap by cataloguing and analysing under-explored domains, applications, and scenarios where forecasting may cause harm, with the goal of developing a novel taxonomy of forecasting-specific harms. Inspired by the Microsoft Azure taxonomy for responsible innovation, we combined a human-led inductive coding scheme with an AI-driven analysis centered on the extraction of key taxonomies of harm in forecasting. The taxonomy is designed to guide researchers and practitioners and encourage ethical reflection on the impact of their decisions during the forecasting process. A secondary objective is to create a research agenda focused on possible forecasting-related measures to mitigate harm. Our work extends the growing literature on machine learning harms by identifying unique forms of harm that may occur in forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hidden Markov Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06963v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We define an evolving in-time Bayesian neural network called a Hidden Markov Neural Network, which addresses the crucial challenge in time-series forecasting and continual learning: striking a balance between adapting to new data and appropriately forgetting outdated information. This is achieved by modelling the weights of a neural network as the hidden states of a Hidden Markov model, with the observed process defined by the available data. A filtering algorithm is employed to learn a variational approximation of the evolving-in-time posterior distribution over the weights. By leveraging a sequential variant of Bayes by Backprop, enriched with a stronger regularization technique called variational DropConnect, Hidden Markov Neural Networks achieve robust regularization and scalable inference. Experiments on MNIST, dynamic classification tasks, and next-frame forecasting in videos demonstrate that Hidden Markov Neural Networks provide strong predictive performance while enabling effective uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartInsighter: An Approach for Mitigating Hallucination in Time-series Chart Summary Generation with A Benchmark Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09349v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective chart summary can significantly reduce the time and effort decision makers spend interpreting charts, enabling precise and efficient communication of data insights. Previous studies have faced challenges in generating accurate and semantically rich summaries of time-series data charts. In this paper, we identify summary elements and common hallucination types in the generation of time-series chart summaries, which serve as our guidelines for automatic generation. We introduce ChartInsighter, which automatically generates chart summaries of time-series data, effectively reducing hallucinations in chart summary generation. Specifically, we assign multiple agents to generate the initial chart summary and collaborate iteratively, during which they invoke external data analysis modules to extract insights and compile them into a coherent summary. Additionally, we implement a self-consistency test method to validate and correct our summary. We create a high-quality benchmark of charts and summaries, with hallucination types annotated on a sentence-by-sentence basis, facilitating the evaluation of the effectiveness of reducing hallucinations. Our evaluations using our benchmark show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art models, and that our summary hallucination rate is the lowest, which effectively reduces various hallucinations and improves summary quality. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/wangfen01/ChartInsighter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free-Knots Kolmogorov-Arnold Network: On the Analysis of Spline Knots and Advancing Stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09283v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Networks (KANs) have gained significant attention in the machine learning community. However, their implementation often suffers from poor training stability and heavy trainable parameter. Furthermore, there is limited understanding of the behavior of the learned activation functions derived from B-splines. In this work, we analyze the behavior of KANs through the lens of spline knots and derive the lower and upper bound for the number of knots in B-spline-based KANs. To address existing limitations, we propose a novel Free Knots KAN that enhances the performance of the original KAN while reducing the number of trainable parameters to match the trainable parameter scale of standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Additionally, we introduce new a training strategy to ensure $C^2$ continuity of the learnable spline, resulting in smoother activation compared to the original KAN and improve the training stability by range expansion. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on 8 datasets spanning various domains, including image, text, time series, multimodal, and function approximation tasks. The promising results demonstrates the feasibility of KAN-based network and the effectiveness of proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional TSC methods often struggle with the inherent complexity and variability of time series data. Building on our previous work with the linear law-based transformation (LLT) - which improved classification accuracy by transforming the feature space based on key data patterns - we introduce adaptive law-based transformation (ALT). ALT enhances LLT by incorporating variable-length shifted time windows, enabling it to capture distinguishing patterns of various lengths and thereby handle complex time series more effectively. By mapping features into a linearly separable space, ALT provides a fast, robust, and transparent solution that achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a few hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Short-time Variational Mode Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09174v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational mode decomposition (VMD) and its extensions like Multivariate VMD (MVMD) decompose signals into ensembles of band-limited modes with narrow central frequencies. These methods utilize Fourier transformations to shift signals between time and frequency domains. However, since Fourier transformations span the entire time-domain signal, they are suboptimal for non-stationary time series. We introduce Short-Time Variational Mode Decomposition (STVMD), an innovative extension of the VMD algorithm that incorporates the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) to minimize the impact of local disturbances. STVMD segments signals into short time windows, converting these segments into the frequency domain. It then formulates a variational optimization problem to extract band-limited modes representing the windowed data. The optimization aims to minimize the sum of the bandwidths of these modes across the windowed data, extending the cost functions used in VMD and MVMD. Solutions are derived using the alternating direction method of multipliers, ensuring the extraction of modes with narrow bandwidths. STVMD is divided into dynamic and non-dynamic types, depending on whether the central frequencies vary with time. Our experiments show that non-dynamic STVMD is comparable to VMD with properly sized time windows, while dynamic STVMD better accommodates non-stationary signals, evidenced by reduced mode function errors and tracking of dynamic central frequencies. This effectiveness is validated by steady-state visual-evoked potentials in electroencephalogram signals.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an invaluable tool for disturbance mapping, providing consistent time-series images of the ground regardless of weather or illumination conditions. Despite SAR's potential for disturbance mapping, processing SAR data to an analysis-ready format requires expertise and significant compute resources, particularly for large-scale global analysis. In October 2023, NASA's Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project released the near-global Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR backscatter from Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) dataset, providing publicly available, analysis-ready SAR imagery. In this work, we utilize this new dataset to systematically analyze land surface disturbances. As labeling SAR data is often prohibitively time-consuming, we train a self-supervised vision transformer - which requires no labels to train - on OPERA RTC-S1 data to estimate a per-pixel distribution from the set of baseline imagery and assess disturbances when there is significant deviation from the modeled distribution. To test our model's capability and generality, we evaluate three different natural disasters - which represent high-intensity, abrupt disturbances - from three different regions of the world. Across events, our approach yields high quality delineations: F1 scores exceeding 0.6 and Areas Under the Precision-Recall Curve exceeding 0.65, consistently outperforming existing SAR disturbance methods. Our findings suggest that a self-supervised vision transformer is well-suited for global disturbance mapping and can be a valuable tool for operational, near-global disturbance monitoring, particularly when labeled data does not exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Surrogate Modeling for Explainable Predictive Time Series Corrections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19897v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a local surrogate approach for explainable time-series forecasting. An initially non-interpretable predictive model to improve the forecast of a classical time-series 'base model' is used. 'Explainability' of the correction is provided by fitting the base model again to the data from which the error prediction is removed (subtracted), yielding a difference in the model parameters which can be interpreted. We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the potential of the method to discover and explain underlying patterns in the data.</p></details> |  |

Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Reliability journal</p></details> |

By extracting base weights from KAN layers and incorporating the sparsity-inducing penalty along with ridge regularization, GCKAN infers the Granger causality from time series while enabling automatic time lag selection. Additionally, we propose an algorithm leveraging time-reversed Granger causality to enhance inference accuracy. The algorithm compares prediction and sparse-inducing losses derived from the original and time-reversed series, automatically selecting the casual relationship with the higher score or integrating the results to mitigate spurious connectivities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on Lorenz-96, gene regulatory networks, fMRI BOLD signals, and VAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods in inferring Granger causality from nonlinear, high-dimensional, and limited-sample time series.</p></details> |  |

A large contributor to its popularity is the sense of immersion and interactivity enabled by having real-world motion reflected in the virtual experience accurately and immediately. This user motion, mainly caused by head rotations, induces several technical challenges. For instance, which content is generated and transmitted depends heavily on where the user is looking. Seamless systems, taking user motion into account proactively, will therefore require accurate predictions of upcoming rotations. Training and evaluating such predictors requires vast amounts of orientational input data, which is expensive to gather, as it requires human test subjects. A more feasible approach is to gather a modest dataset through test subjects, and then extend it to a more sizeable set using synthetic data generation methods. In this work, we present a head rotation time series generator based on TimeGAN, an extension of the well-known Generative Adversarial Network, designed specifically for generating time series. This approach is able to extend a dataset of head rotations with new samples closely matching the distribution of the measured time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published and presented at International Conference on Multimedia 2022 (ACMMM), Workshop on Interactive eXtended Reality (IXR)</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08628v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), the use of sensors for online monitoring generates large volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data. Consequently, the need for robust anomaly diagnosis in MTS is paramount to maintaining system reliability and safety. While significant advancements have been made in anomaly detection, localization remains a largely underexplored area, though crucial for intelligent decision-making. This paper introduces a novel transformer-based model for unsupervised anomaly diagnosis in MTS, with a focus on improving localization performance, through an in-depth analysis of the self-attention mechanism's learning behavior under both normal and anomalous conditions. We formulate the anomaly localization problem as a three-stage process: time-step, window, and segment-based. This leads to the development of the Space-Time Anomaly Score (STAS), a new metric inspired by the connection between transformer latent representations and space-time statistical models. STAS is designed to capture individual anomaly behaviors and inter-series dependencies, delivering enhanced localization performance. Additionally, the Statistical Feature Anomaly Score (SFAS) complements STAS by analyzing statistical features around anomalies, with their combination helping to reduce false alarms. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets illustrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CT-PatchTST: Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer for Long-Term Renewable Energy Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08620v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting renewable energy output is crucial for the efficient integration of solar and wind power into modern energy systems. This study develops and evaluates an advanced deep learning model, Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer (CT-PatchTST), to forecast the power output of photovoltaic and wind energy systems using annual offshore wind power, onshore wind power, and solar power generation data from Denmark. While the original Patch Time-Series Transformer(PatchTST) model employs a channel-independent (CI) approach, it tends to overlook inter-channel relationships during training, potentially leading to a loss of critical information. To address this limitation and further leverage the benefits of increased data granularity brought by CI, we propose CT-PatchTST. This enhanced model improves the processing of inter-channel information while maintaining the advantages of the channel-independent approach. The predictive performance of CT-PatchTST is rigorously analyzed, demonstrating its ability to provide precise and reliable energy forecasts. This work contributes to improving the predictability of renewable energy systems, supporting their broader adoption and integration into energy grids.</p></details> |  |

Typically, feature computation is divided into two distinct phases, i.e., offline stage for model training and online stage for model serving. These phases often rely on execution engines with different interface languages and function implementations, causing significant inconsistencies. Moreover, many online ML features involve complex time-series computations (e.g., functions over varied-length table windows) that differ from standard streaming and analytical queries. Existing data processing systems (e.g., Spark, Flink, DuckDB) often incur multi-second latencies for these computations, making them unsuitable for real-time online ML applications that demand timely feature updates. This paper presents OpenMLDB, a feature computation system deployed in 4Paradigm's SageOne platform and over 100 real scenarios. Technically, OpenMLDB first employs a unified query plan generator for consistent computation results across the offline and online stages, significantly reducing feature deployment overhead. Second, OpenMLDB provides an online execution engine that resolves performance bottlenecks caused by long window computations (via pre-aggregation) and multi-table window unions (via data self-adjusting). It also provides a high-performance offline execution engine with window parallel optimization and time-aware data skew resolving. Third, OpenMLDB features a compact data format and stream-focused indexing to maximize memory usage and accelerate data access. Evaluations in testing and real workloads reveal significant performance improvements and resource savings compared to the baseline systems. The open community of OpenMLDB now has over 150 contributors and gained 1.6k stars on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Besides the mirroring of the physical word into the digital, there is the need of providing services related to the data collected and transferred to the virtual world. One of these services is the forecasting of physical part future behavior, that could lead to applications, like preventing harmful events or designing improvements to get better performance. One strategy used to predict any system operation it is the use of time series models like ARIMA or LSTM, and improvements were implemented using these algorithms. Recently, deep learning techniques based on generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been proposed to create time series and the use of LSTM has gained more relevance in time series forecasting, but both have limitations that restrict the forecasting results. Another issue found in the literature is the challenge of handling multivariate environments/applications in time series generation. Therefore, new methods need to be studied in order to fill these gaps and, consequently, provide better resources for creating useful digital twins. In this proposal, it is going to be studied the integration of a BiLSTM layer with a time series obtained by GAN in order to improve the forecasting of all the features provided by the dataset in terms of accuracy and, consequently, improving behaviour prediction.</p></details> |  |

Our model involves a collection of time series of random networks of growing size, where some of the time series are associated with responses. Assuming that the collection of time series admits an unknown lower dimensional structure, our method exploits the underlying structure to consistently predict responses at the unlabeled time series of networks. Each time series represents a multilayer network on a common set of nodes, and raw stress embedding, a popular dimensionality reduction tool, is used for capturing the unknown latent low dimensional structure. Apart from establishing theoretical convergence guarantees and supporting them with numerical results, we demonstrate the use of our method in the analysis of real-world biological learning circuits of larval Drosophila.</p></details> |  |

| **[Pathwise guessing in categorical time series with unbounded alphabets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06547v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The following learning problem arises naturally in various applications: Given a finite sample from a categorical or count time series, can we learn a function of the sample that (nearly) maximizes the probability of correctly guessing the values of a given portion of the data using the values from the remaining parts? Unlike the classical task of estimating conditional probabilities in a stochastic process, our approach avoids explicitly estimating these probabilities. We propose a non-parametric guessing function with a learning rate that is independent of the alphabet size. Our analysis focuses on a broad class of time series models that encompasses finite-order Markov chains, some hidden Markov chains, Poisson regression for count process, and one-dimensional Gibbs measures. Additionally, we establish a minimax lower bound for the rate of convergence of the risk associated with our guessing problem. This lower bound matches the upper bound achieved by our estimator up to a logarithmic factor, demonstrating its near-optimality.</p></details> | 21 pages, submitted |

Introducing a novel framework, we define a distance metric within the parameter space of the INAR($\infty$) model, which improves parameter estimation capabilities. Employing a least-squares estimator, we derive its theoretical properties, demonstrating its equivalence to a norm-based metric and establishing its optimality within this framework. To validate the estimator's performance, we conduct comprehensive numerical experiments with sample sizes $T=200$ and $T=500$. These simulations reveal that the estimator accurately recovers the true parameters and exhibits asymptotic normality, as confirmed by statistical tests and visual assessments such as histograms and Q--Q plots. Our findings provide empirical support for the theoretical underpinnings of the cumulative INAR($\infty$) model and affirm the efficacy of the proposed estimation method. This work not only deepens the understanding of infinite-order count time series models but also establishes parallels with continuous-time Hawkes processes.</p></details> |  |

This work combines the strengths of both to generate fast surrogate models with adjustable complexity reacting on time-varying inputs signals. By leveraging the VAE's dimensionality reduction using a nonhierarchical prior, our method adaptively assigns stochastic noise, naturally complementing known NeuralODE training enhancements and enabling probabilistic time series modeling. We show that standard Latent ODEs struggle with dimensionality reduction in systems with time-varying inputs. Our approach mitigates this by continuously propagating variational parameters through time, establishing fixed information channels in latent space. This results in a flexible and robust method that can learn different system complexities, e.g. deep neural networks or linear matrices. Hereby, it enables efficient approximation of the Koopman operator without the need for predefining its dimensionality. As our method balances dimensionality reduction and reconstruction accuracy, we call it Balanced Neural ODE (B-NODE). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methods on several academic and real-world test cases, e.g. a power plant or MuJoCo data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper under review, after revision</p></details> |
| **[Convergence Analysis of Real-time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) for a class of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08040v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly trained with the truncated backpropagation-through-time (TBPTT) algorithm. For the purposes of computational tractability, the TBPTT algorithm truncates the chain rule and calculates the gradient on a finite block of the overall data sequence. Such approximation could lead to significant inaccuracies, as the block length for the truncated backpropagation is typically limited to be much smaller than the overall sequence length. In contrast, Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is an online optimization algorithm which asymptotically follows the true gradient of the loss on the data sequence as the number of sequence time steps $t \rightarrow \infty$. RTRL forward propagates the derivatives of the RNN hidden/memory units with respect to the parameters and, using the forward derivatives, performs online updates of the parameters at each time step in the data sequence. RTRL's online forward propagation allows for exact optimization over extremely long data sequences, although it can be computationally costly for models with large numbers of parameters. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm for a class of RNNs. The convergence analysis establishes a fixed point for the joint distribution of the data sequence, RNN hidden layer, and the RNN hidden layer forward derivatives as the number of data samples from the sequence and the number of training steps tend to infinity. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm to a stationary point of the loss. Numerical studies illustrate our theoretical results. One potential application area for RTRL is the analysis of financial data, which typically involve long time series and models with small to medium numbers of parameters. This makes RTRL computationally tractable and a potentially appealing optimization method for training models. Thus, we include an example of RTRL applied to limit order book data.</p></details> |  |

The development of sensor technologies opens many new ways to be able to measure high-quality signals. The development of such an aim-specific sensor can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to test or validate with known and consistent waveforms. In this paper, we present an open source blood pressure waveform simulator with an open source Python validation package to reduce development costs for early-stage sensor development and research. The simulator mainly consists of 3D printed parts which technology has become a widely available and cheap solution. The core part of the simulator is a 3D printed cam that can be generated based on real blood pressure waveforms. The validation framework can create a detailed comparison between the signal waveform used to design the cam and the measured time series from the sensor being validated. The presented simulator proved to be robust and accurate in short- and long-term use, as it produced the signal waveform consistently and accurately. To validate this solution, a 3D force sensor was used, which was proven earlier to be able to measure high-quality blood pressure waveforms on the radial artery at the wrist. The results showed high similarity between the measured and the nominal waveforms, meaning that comparing the normalized signals, the RMSE value ranged from $0.0276 \pm 0.0047$ to $0.0212 \pm 0.0023$, and the Pearson correlation ranged from $0.9933 \pm 0.0027$ to $0.9978 \pm 0.0005$.

| **[Logarithmic Memory Networks (LMNs): Efficient Long-Range Sequence Modeling for Resource-Constrained Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07905v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-range sequence modeling is a crucial aspect of natural language processing and time series analysis. However, traditional models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers suffer from computational and memory inefficiencies, especially when dealing with long sequences. This paper introduces Logarithmic Memory Networks (LMNs), a novel architecture that leverages a hierarchical logarithmic tree structure to efficiently store and retrieve past information. LMNs dynamically summarize historical context, significantly reducing the memory footprint and computational complexity of attention mechanisms from O(n2) to O(log(n)). The model employs a single-vector, targeted attention mechanism to access stored information, and the memory block construction worker (summarizer) layer operates in two modes: a parallel execution mode during training for efficient processing of hierarchical tree structures and a sequential execution mode during inference, which acts as a memory management system. It also implicitly encodes positional information, eliminating the need for explicit positional encodings. These features make LMNs a robust and scalable solution for processing long-range sequences in resource-constrained environments, offering practical improvements in efficiency and scalability.

| **[Data-driven Bayesian State Estimation with Compressed Measurement of Model-free Process using Semi-supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The research topic is: data-driven Bayesian state estimation with compressed measurement (BSCM) of model-free process, say for a (causal) tracking application. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than the dimension of the temporal state vector to be estimated. Hence the state estimation problem is an underdetermined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the states is assumed to be unknown and hence, we use the terminology 'model-free process'. In absence of the dynamical model, we can not employ traditional model-driven methods like Kalman Filter (KF) and Particle Filter (PF), and instead require data-driven methods. We first experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem for model-free process; they are - data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method and deep Markov model (DMM) method. The unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data comprised of only noisy, linear measurements. While DANSE provides a good predictive / forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as time-series, its unsupervised learning lacks a regularization for state estimation. We then investigate the use of a semi-supervised learning approach, and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a limited amount of labelled data along-with a large amount of unlabelled data, and that helps to bring the desired regularization for addressing the BSCM problem. The labelled data means pairwise measurement-and-state data. Using three chaotic dynamical systems (or processes) with nonlinear dynamical models as benchmark, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive performance for BSCM against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods -- an extended KF (EKF) and an unscented KF (UKF).</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, under review at IEEE TSP</p></details> |

Digital twins (DTs), embodying real-time monitoring, predictive configurations, and enhanced decision-making capabilities, stand out as a promising solution in this context. Within a time-series data-driven framework that effectively maps wireless networks into digital counterparts, encapsulated by integrated vertical and horizontal twinning phases, this study investigates the security challenges in distributed network DT systems, which potentially undermine the reliability of subsequent network applications such as wireless traffic forecasting. Specifically, we consider a minimal-knowledge scenario for all attackers, in that they do not have access to network data and other specialized knowledge, yet can interact with previous iterations of server-level models. In this context, we spotlight a novel fake traffic injection attack designed to compromise a distributed network DT system for wireless traffic prediction. In response, we then propose a defense mechanism, termed global-local inconsistency detection (GLID), to counteract various model poisoning threats. GLID strategically removes abnormal model parameters that deviate beyond a particular percentile range, thereby fortifying the security of network twinning process. Through extensive experiments on real-world wireless traffic datasets, our experimental evaluations show that both our attack and defense strategies significantly outperform existing baselines, highlighting the importance of security measures in the design and implementation of DTs for 5G and beyond network systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Internet of Things Journal (IoT-J). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2404.14389</p></details> |

However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages |

While new diseases exhibit unique behaviors, they often share fundamental characteristics from a dynamical systems perspective. Moreover, measurements during disease outbreaks are often corrupted by different noise sources, posing challenges for Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks. In this study, we address the problem of having a robust EWS for disease outbreak prediction using a best-performing deep learning model in the domain of TSC. We employed two simulated datasets to train the model: one representing generated dynamical systems with randomly selected polynomial terms to model new disease behaviors, and another simulating noise-induced disease dynamics to account for noisy measurements. The model's performance was analyzed using both simulated data from different disease models and real-world data, including influenza and COVID-19. Results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms previous models, effectively providing EWSs of impending outbreaks across various scenarios. This study bridges advancements in deep learning with the ability to provide robust early warning signals in noisy environments, making it highly applicable to real-world crises involving emerging disease outbreaks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |

For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Performance of Echo State Networks Through State Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15141v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing, using nonlinear dynamical systems, offers a cost-effective alternative to neural networks for complex tasks involving processing of sequential data, time series modeling, and system identification. Echo state networks (ESNs), a type of reservoir computer, mirror neural networks but simplify training. They apply fixed, random linear transformations to the internal state, followed by nonlinear changes. This process, guided by input signals and linear regression, adapts the system to match target characteristics, reducing computational demands. A potential drawback of ESNs is that the fixed reservoir may not offer the complexity needed for specific problems. While directly altering (training) the internal ESN would reintroduce the computational burden, an indirect modification can be achieved by redirecting some output as input. This feedback can influence the internal reservoir state, yielding ESNs with enhanced complexity suitable for broader challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate that by feeding some component of the reservoir state back into the network through the input, we can drastically improve upon the performance of a given ESN. We rigorously prove that, for any given ESN, feedback will almost always improve the accuracy of the output. For a set of three tasks, each representing different problem classes, we find that with feedback the average error measures are reduced by $30\%-60\%$. Remarkably, feedback provides at least an equivalent performance boost to doubling the initial number of computational nodes, a computationally expensive and technologically challenging alternative. These results demonstrate the broad applicability and substantial usefulness of this feedback scheme.</p></details> | 36 pages, 6 figures |

These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}</p></details> |  |

Their performance derives from aggregating predictions of multiple decision trees, which are renowned for their interpretability properties. However, tree ensemble models do not reliably exhibit interpretable output. Our work aims to extract an optimized list of rules from a trained tree ensemble, providing the user with a condensed, interpretable model that retains most of the predictive power of the full model. Our approach consists of solving a set partitioning problem formulated through Integer Programming. The proposed method works with either tabular or time series data, for both classification and regression tasks, and its flexible formulation can include any arbitrary loss or regularization functions. Our extensive computational experiments offer statistically significant evidence that our method is competitive with other rule extraction methods in terms of predictive performance and fidelity towards the tree ensemble. Moreover, we empirically show that the proposed method effectively extracts interpretable rules from tree ensemble that are designed for time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>- Imp...</summary><p>- Improved overall manuscript flow and clearness - Added related work on explanation fidelity - Added computational results on fidelity - Fixed some flaws on data inference - Optimization problem with weighted objectives - Added appendix containing qualitative examples - New computational results</p></details> |

The reasons are twofold. First, labels for multi-modal time series data are coarse and devoid of analysis or reasoning processes. Training with these data cannot improve the model's reasoning capabilities. Second, due to the lack of precise tokenization in processing time series, the representation patterns for temporal and textual information are inconsistent, which hampers the effectiveness of multi-modal alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal time series data construction approach and a multi-modal time series language model (TLM), TempoGPT. Specially, we construct multi-modal data for complex reasoning tasks by analyzing the variable-system relationships within a white-box system. Additionally, proposed TempoGPT achieves consistent representation between temporal and textual information by quantizing temporal embeddings, where temporal embeddings are quantized into a series of discrete tokens using a predefined codebook; subsequently, a shared embedding layer processes both temporal and textual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoGPT accurately perceives temporal information, logically infers conclusions, and achieves state-of-the-art in the constructed complex time series reasoning tasks. Moreover, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of quantizing temporal embeddings in enhancing multi-modal alignment and the reasoning capabilities of TLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanghaochuan20/TempoGPT.</p></details> |  |

Gaps in smart meter data can bias consumption analyses and hinder reliable predictions, causing technical and economic inefficiencies. As smart meter data grows in volume and complexity, conventional techniques struggle with its nonlinear and nonstationary patterns. In this context, Generative Artificial Intelligence offers promising solutions that may outperform traditional statistical methods. In this paper, we evaluate two general-purpose Large Language Models and five Time Series Foundation Models for smart meter data imputation, comparing them with conventional Machine Learning and statistical models. We introduce artificial gaps (30 minutes to one day) into an anonymized public dataset to test inference capabilities. Results show that Time Series Foundation Models, with their contextual understanding and pattern recognition, could significantly enhance imputation accuracy in certain cases. However, the trade-off between computational cost and performance gains remains a critical consideration.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, clustering is often used to group similar abnormal behavior. However, evaluating cluster quality without ground truth is challenging, as existing measures such as the Silhouette Score (SSC) only evaluate the cohesion and separation of clusters and ignore possible prior knowledge about the data. To address this challenge, we introduce the Synchronized Anomaly Agreement Index (SAAI), which exploits the synchronicity of anomalies across multivariate time series to assess cluster quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAAI by showing that maximizing SAAI improves accuracy on the task of finding the true number of anomaly classes K in correlated time series by 0.23 compared to SSC and by 0.32 compared to X-Means. We also show that clusters obtained by maximizing SAAI are easier to interpret compared to SSC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accce...</summary><p>Acccepted at AAAI Workshop on AI for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS) 2025</p></details> |

However, the quality of the data is crucial to the effectiveness of applications built on it, and assessment of the data quality is heavily context-dependent. Further, preserving the privacy of the data during quality assessment is critical in domains where sensitive data is prevalent. This paper proposes a novel framework for automated, objective, and privacy-preserving data quality assessment of time-series data from IoT sensors deployed in smart cities. We leverage custom, autonomously computable metrics that parameterise the temporal performance and adherence to a declarative schema document to achieve objectivity. Additionally, we utilise a trusted execution environment to create a "data-blind" model that ensures individual privacy, eliminates assessee bias, and enhances adaptability across data types. This paper describes this data quality assessment methodology for IoT sensors, emphasising its relevance within the smart-city context while addressing the growing need for privacy in the face of extensive data collection practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, published - IoTaIS 2024 Conference Proceedings</p></details> |

Consequently, the regression model could neglect the data 's interrelationships, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance. Moreover, the existence of aleatoric uncertainty in the training data may drive the model to capture non-generalizable patterns, contributing to increased overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a novel adaptive pairwise learning framework (AdaPRL) for regression tasks which leverages the relative differences between data points and integrates with deep probabilistic models to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Additionally, we adapt AdaPRL for applications in multi-task learning and multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments with several real-world regression datasets including recommendation systems, age estimation, time series forecasting, natural language understanding, finance, and industry datasets show that AdaPRL is compatible with different backbone networks in various tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the vast majority of tasks, highlighting its notable potential including enhancing prediction accuracy and ranking ability, increasing generalization capability, improving robustness to noisy data, improving resilience to reduced data, and enhancing interpretability, etc.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures |

State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</p></details> |  |

This fusion of information creates a comprehensive representation, which is then processed through a linear layer to generate the final forecast. Extensive experiments demonstrate that incorporating text enhances high-dimensional time series forecasting performance.

Traditional models like the Safe Distance Model and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) require precise parameter calibration and often lack generality due to simplified assumptions about driver behavior. While machine learning and deep learning methods capture complex patterns, they require large labeled datasets. Foundation models provide a more efficient alternative. Pre-trained on vast, diverse time series datasets, they can be applied directly to various tasks without the need for extensive re-training. These models generalize well across domains, and with minimal fine-tuning, they can be adapted to specific tasks like car-following behavior prediction. In this paper, we apply Chronos, a state-of-the-art public time series foundation model, to analyze car-following behavior using the Open ACC dataset. Without fine-tuning, Chronos outperforms traditional models like IDM and Exponential smoothing with trend and seasonality (ETS), and achieves similar results to deep learning models such as DeepAR and TFT, with an RMSE of 0.60. After fine-tuning, Chronos reduces the error to an RMSE of 0.53, representing a 33.75% improvement over IDM and a 12-37% reduction compared to machine learning models like ETS and deep learning models including DeepAR, WaveNet, and TFT. This demonstrates the potential of foundation models to significantly advance transportation research, offering a scalable, adaptable, and highly accurate approach to predicting and simulating car-following behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Latent Neural Dynamics with Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03330v3)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how the collective activity of neural populations relates to computation and ultimately behavior is a key goal in neuroscience. To this end, statistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms of low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in characterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method involves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to capture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of interpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper, we develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work modeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation whose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We propose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable -- dynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS). Our approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual oscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing posterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage a modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel hyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our method to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Explaining Datasets in Words: Statistical Models with Natural Language Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08466v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To make sense of massive data, we often fit simplified models and then interpret the parameters; for example, we cluster the text embeddings and then interpret the mean parameters of each cluster. However, these parameters are often high-dimensional and hard to interpret. To make model parameters directly interpretable, we introduce a family of statistical models -- including clustering, time series, and classification models -- parameterized by natural language predicates. For example, a cluster of text about COVID could be parameterized by the predicate "discusses COVID". To learn these statistical models effectively, we develop a model-agnostic algorithm that optimizes continuous relaxations of predicate parameters with gradient descent and discretizes them by prompting language models (LMs). Finally, we apply our framework to a wide range of problems: taxonomizing user chat dialogues, characterizing how they evolve across time, finding categories where one language model is better than the other, clustering math problems based on subareas, and explaining visual features in memorable images. Our framework is highly versatile, applicable to both textual and visual domains, can be easily steered to focus on specific properties (e.g. subareas), and explains sophisticated concepts that classical methods (e.g. n-gram analysis) struggle to produce.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAM: Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset for Stable LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06842v1)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse tasks, yet their training remains highly resource-intensive and susceptible to critical challenges such as training instability. A predominant source of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt the learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint recovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM training, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and datasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to $1000\times$ larger than typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To address this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset SPAM, a novel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both pre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam and its variants across various tasks, including (1) LLM pre-training from 60M to 1B, (2) 4-bit LLM pre-training,(3) reinforcement learning, and (4) Time Series Forecasting. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by enabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained and updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms state-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini. Our work underscores the importance of mitigating gradient spikes in LLM training and introduces an effective optimization strategy that enhances both training stability and resource efficiency at scale.

While often demonstrating promising results, the transformer architecture encounters challenges in fully exploiting the temporal relations within time series data due to its attention mechanism. In this work, we design eXponential Patch (xPatch for short), a novel dual-stream architecture that utilizes exponential decomposition. Inspired by the classical exponential smoothing approaches, xPatch introduces the innovative seasonal-trend exponential decomposition module. Additionally, we propose a dual-flow architecture that consists of an MLP-based linear stream and a CNN-based non-linear stream. This model investigates the benefits of employing patching and channel-independence techniques within a non-transformer model. Finally, we develop a robust arctangent loss function and a sigmoid learning rate adjustment scheme, which prevent overfitting and boost forecasting performance.

While existing transformer-based models have outperformed long short-term memory networks and convolutional neural networks in financial time series prediction, their high computational complexity and memory requirements limit their practicality for real-time trading and long-sequence data processing. To address these challenges, we propose SAMBA, an innovative framework for stock return prediction that builds on the Mamba architecture and integrates graph neural networks. SAMBA achieves near-linear computational complexity by utilizing a bidirectional Mamba block to capture long-term dependencies in historical price data and employing adaptive graph convolution to model dependencies between daily stock features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAMBA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy, maintaining low computational complexity.

In these applications, a common need is to compute Tucker decomposition for a given time range. Furthermore, real-world tensor time series are typically evolving in the time dimension. Such needs call for a data structure that can efficiently and accurately support range queries of Tucker decomposition and stream updates. Unfortunately, existing methods do not support either range queries or stream updates. This challenging problem has remained open for years prior to our work. To solve this challenging problem, we propose TUCKET, a data structure that can efficiently and accurately handle both range queries and stream updates. Our key idea is to design a new data structure that we call a stream segment tree by generalizing the segment tree, a data structure that was originally invented for computational geometry. For a range query of length $L$, our TUCKET can find $O(\log L)$ nodes (called the hit set) from the tree and efficiently stitch their preprocessed decompositions to answer the range query. We also propose an algorithm to optimally prune the hit set via an approximation of subtensor decomposition. For the $T$-th stream update, our TUCKET modifies only amortized $O(1)$ nodes and only $O(\log T)$ nodes in the worst case. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our TUCKET consistently achieves the highest efficiency and accuracy across four large-scale datasets. Our TUCKET achieves at least 3 times lower latency and at least 1.4 times smaller reconstruction error than Zoom-Tucker on all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VLDB 2025</p></details> |

Among various methods, diffusion model-based approaches show notable performance improvements. However, existing methods often cause disharmonious boundaries between missing and known regions and overlook long-range dependencies in missing data estimation, leading to suboptimal results. To address these issues, we propose a Diffusion-based time Series Data Imputation (DSDI) framework. We develop a weight-reducing injection strategy that incorporates the predicted values of missing points with reducing weights into the reverse diffusion process to mitigate boundary inconsistencies. Further, we introduce a multi-scale S4-based U-Net, which combines hierarchical information from different levels via multi-resolution integration to capture long-term dependencies.

On-demand meal delivery platforms seek to optimize real-time operations based on anticipatory insights into citywide demand distributions. To address these needs, this study proposes a short-term predict-then-cluster framework for on-demand meal delivery services. The framework utilizes ensemble-learning methods for point and distributional forecasting with multivariate features, including lagged-dependent inputs to capture demand dynamics. We introduce Constrained K-Means Clustering (CKMC) and Contiguity Constrained Hierarchical Clustering with Iterative Constraint Enforcement (CCHC-ICE) to generate dynamic clusters based on predicted demand and geographical proximity, tailored to user-defined operational constraints. Evaluations of European and Taiwanese case studies demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform traditional time series approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Clustering results demonstrate that the incorporation of distributional predictions effectively addresses demand uncertainties, improving the quality of operational insights. Additionally, a simulation study demonstrates the practical value of short-term demand predictions for proactive strategies, such as idle fleet rebalancing, significantly enhancing delivery efficiency. By addressing demand uncertainties and operational constraints, our predict-then-cluster framework provides actionable insights for optimizing real-time operations. The approach is adaptable to other on-demand platform-based city logistics and passenger mobility services, promoting sustainable and efficient urban operations.</p></details> |  |

Despite the existence of many detectors to solve this problem, one cannot simply define why an obtained anomaly inferred by the detector is anomalous. This reasoning is required for network operators to understand the root cause of the anomaly and the remedial action that should be taken to counteract its occurrence. Existing solutions in explainable AI may give cues to features that influence an anomaly, but they do not formulate generalizable rules that can be assessed by a domain expert. Furthermore, not all outliers are anomalous in a business sense. There is an unfulfilled need for a system that can interpret anomalies predicted by a multivariate anomaly detector and map these patterns to actionable rules. This paper aims to fulfill this need by proposing a semi-autonomous anomaly rule miner. The proposed method is applicable to both discrete and time series data and is tailored for radio access network (RAN) anomaly detection use cases. The proposed method is demonstrated in this paper with time series RAN data.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose multi-view signature attention, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Conference (Camera Ready Version)</p></details> |

Attention in transformer-based methods requires something worth attending to -- more than just samples of a time-series. We explore different methods to map multivariate input time series into the LLM token embedding space. In particular, our novel multivariate patching strategy to embed time series features into decoder-only pre-trained Transformers produces results competitive with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models. We also use recently-developed weight-based diagnostics to validate our findings.</p></details> |  |

Building on the recently introduced Bayesian Context Trees (BCT) framework, the distributions of different segments in a discrete time series are described as variable-memory Markov chains. Inference for the presence and location of change-points is then performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The key observation that facilitates effective sampling is that, using one of the BCT algorithms, the prior predictive likelihood of the data can be computed exactly, integrating out all the models and parameters in each segment. This makes it possible to sample directly from the posterior distribution of the number and location of the change-points, leading to accurate estimates and providing a natural quantitative measure of uncertainty in the results. Estimates of the actual model in each segment can also be obtained, at essentially no additional computational cost. Results on both simulated and real-world data indicate that the proposed methodology performs better than or as well as state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Link ...</summary><p>Link to R-package: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BCT</p></details> |

However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multi-variate deep neural network (DNN), named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Different from the models in conventional MPC which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10%-30%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to the PID controller, MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</p></details> |  |

This reliance on manual inspection often leads to inefficiencies and constrains the ability to scale for widespread exoplanet detection, ultimately hindering discovery rates. To address the limits of traditional microlensing event vetting, we have developed LensNet, a machine learning pipeline specifically designed to distinguish legitimate microlensing events from false positives caused by instrumental artifacts, such as pixel bleed trails and diffraction spikes. Our system operates in conjunction with a preliminary algorithm that detects increasing trends in flux. These flagged instances are then passed to LensNet for further classification, allowing for timely alerts and follow-up observations. Tailored for the multi-observatory setup of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and trained on a rich dataset of manually classified events, LensNet is optimized for early detection and warning of microlensing occurrences, enabling astronomers to organize follow-up observations promptly. The internal model of the pipeline employs a multi-branch Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that evaluates time-series flux data with contextual information, including sky background, the full width at half maximum of the target star, flux errors, PSF quality flags, and air mass for each observation. We demonstrate a classification accuracy above 87.5%, and anticipate further improvements as we expand our training set and continue to refine the algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, Accepted for publication in the The Astronomical Journal</p></details> |
| **[Analyzing Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Dissolved Oxygen for the River Thames using Superstatistical Methods and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07599v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By employing superstatistical methods and machine learning, we analyze time series data of water quality indicators for the River Thames, with a specific focus on the dynamics of dissolved oxygen. After detrending, the probability density functions of dissolved oxygen fluctuations exhibit heavy tails that are effectively modeled using $q$-Gaussian distributions. Our findings indicate that the multiplicative Empirical Mode Decomposition method stands out as the most effective detrending technique, yielding the highest log-likelihood in nearly all fittings. We also observe that the optimally fitted width parameter of the $q$-Gaussian shows a negative correlation with the distance to the sea, highlighting the influence of geographical factors on water quality dynamics. In the context of same-time prediction of dissolved oxygen, regression analysis incorporating various water quality indicators and temporal features identify the Light Gradient Boosting Machine as the best model. SHapley Additive exPlanations reveal that temperature, pH, and time of year play crucial roles in the predictions. Furthermore, we use the Transformer to forecast dissolved oxygen concentrations. For long-term forecasting, the Informer model consistently delivers superior performance, achieving the lowest MAE and SMAPE with the 192 historical time steps that we used. This performance is attributed to the Informer's ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which allows it to capture long-range dependencies in time-series data more effectively than other machine learning models. It effectively recognizes the half-life cycle of dissolved oxygen, with particular attention to key intervals. Our findings provide valuable insights for policymakers involved in ecological health assessments, aiding in accurate predictions of river water quality and the maintenance of healthy aquatic ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Erasmo1015/vte.</p></details> | AAMAS 2025 |

We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems.

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Generation of Near-Minimum-Energy Trajectories via Constraint-Informed Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09450v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial robotics demands significant energy to operate, making energy-reduction methodologies increasingly important. Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories in scenarios where measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MGF: Mixed Gaussian Flow for Diverse Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12238v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To predict future trajectories, the normalizing flow with a standard Gaussian prior suffers from weak diversity. The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses. Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction. The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric. Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation. We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF). It achieves state-of-the-art performance in the evaluation of both trajectory alignment and diversity on the popular UCY/ETH and SDD datasets.

| **[Predicting 4D Hand Trajectory from Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08329v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HaPTIC, an approach that infers coherent 4D hand trajectories from monocular videos. Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Social Interactions Learning With Random Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07711v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical technology in the evolution of self-driving cars toward complete artificial intelligence. Over recent years, focusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions has surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions. However, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In this work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data, with the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social interactions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN innovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the need for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of DTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training, which yields improvements of 16.7\% and 39.3\% on metrics ADE and FDE, respectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN achieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians' intentions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,7 figures,Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Computing Safety Margins of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment via Trajectory Sensitivities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07498v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential to disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the system recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and time-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the safety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal value such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the disturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related methods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often either overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional systems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins efficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the system trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small perturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work develops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory sensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence guarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful application to a large class of nonlinear systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

While promising approaches exist, they often revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in traffic environments. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art, reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) by 8.8% while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |
| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

It is often due to limitations like complex architectures customized for a specific dataset and inefficient multimodal handling. We propose Perceiver with Register queries (PerReg+), a novel trajectory prediction framework that introduces: (1) Dual-Level Representation Learning via Self-Distillation (SD) and Masked Reconstruction (MR), capturing global context and fine-grained details. Additionally, our approach of reconstructing segmentlevel trajectories and lane segments from masked inputs with query drop, enables effective use of contextual information and improves generalization; (2) Enhanced Multimodality using register-based queries and pretraining, eliminating the need for clustering and suppression; and (3) Adaptive Prompt Tuning during fine-tuning, freezing the main architecture and optimizing a small number of prompts for efficient adaptation. PerReg+ sets a new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes [1], Argoverse 2 [2], and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [3]. Remarkable, our pretrained model reduces the error by 6.8% on smaller datasets, and multi-dataset training enhances generalization. In cross-domain tests, PerReg+ reduces B-FDE by 11.8% compared to its non-pretrained variant.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods based on the motion manifold hypothesis, which assumes that a set of trajectories lies on a lower-dimensional nonlinear subspace, address challenges such as limited dataset size and the high dimensionality of trajectory data, they often struggle to capture complex task-motion dependencies, i.e., when motion distributions shift drastically with task variations. To address this, we introduce Motion Manifold Flow Primitives (MMFP), a framework that decouples the training of the motion manifold from task-conditioned distributions. Specifically, we employ flow matching models, state-of-the-art conditional deep generative models, to learn task-conditioned distributions in the latent coordinate space of the learned motion manifold. Experiments are conducted on language-guided trajectory generation tasks, where many-to-many text-motion correspondences introduce complex task-motion dependencies, highlighting MMFP's superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

In this task, the model is required to make predictions based on natural language instructions, egocentric view images before manipulation, and the given end-effector trajectories. Conventional methods typically perform success prediction only after the manipulation is executed, limiting their efficiency in executing the entire task sequence. We propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions. We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict manipulation outcomes accurately. We constructed a dataset based on the RT-1 dataset, a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks, to evaluate our method.

This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

These forecasts allow us to anticipate events that lead to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but overconfidence and weak uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens) aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function.

| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Collision Risk Quantification and Conflict Resolution in Trajectory Tracking for Acceleration-Actuated Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03585v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the pivotal challenges in a multi-robot system is how to give attention to accuracy and efficiency while ensuring safety. Prior arts cannot strictly guarantee collision-free for an arbitrarily large number of robots or the results are considerably conservative. Smoothness of the avoidance trajectory also needs to be further optimized. This paper proposes an accelerationactuated simultaneous obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking method for arbitrarily large teams of robots, that provides a nonconservative collision avoidance strategy and gives approaches for deadlock avoidance. We propose two ways of deadlock resolution, one involves incorporating an auxiliary velocity vector into the error function of the trajectory tracking module, which is proven to have no influence on global convergence of the tracking error. Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that they address conflicts after a deadlock occurs, our decision-making mechanism avoids the near-zero velocity, which is much more safer and efficient in crowed environments. Extensive comparison show that the proposed method is superior to the existing studies when deployed in a large-scale robot system, with minimal invasiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Cell Type Developmental Trajectory using Multinomial Unbalanced Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03501v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell trajectory analysis aims to reconstruct the biological developmental processes of cells as they evolve over time, leveraging temporal correlations in gene expression. During cellular development, gene expression patterns typically change and vary across different cell types. A significant challenge in this analysis is that RNA sequencing destroys the cell, making it impossible to track gene expression across multiple stages for the same cell. Recent advances have introduced the use of optimal transport tools to model the trajectory of individual cells. In this paper, our focus shifts to a question of greater practical importance: we examine the differentiation of cell types over time. Specifically, we propose a novel method based on discrete unbalanced optimal transport to model the developmental trajectory of cell types. Our method detects biological changes in cell types and infers their transitions to different states by analyzing the transport matrix. We validated our method using single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The results accurately identified major developmental changes in cell types, which were corroborated by experimental evidence. Furthermore, the inferred transition probabilities between cell types are highly congruent to biological ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Constrained Generative Artificial Intelligence for Rapid Takeoff Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03445v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To aid urban air mobility (UAM), electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft are being targeted. Conventional multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization can struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes physics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to intelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft and to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically, the transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly satisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The physicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in the feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The proposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with simulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the computational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled surrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free optimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed framework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using gradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during random trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in real practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework outperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2 seconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible). According to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained generative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference version with 10 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Through-The-Mask: Mask-based Motion Trajectories for Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03059v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, which involves transforming static images into realistic video sequences based on a textual description. While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce \benchmark, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Holistic Semantic Representation for Navigational Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02737v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation has garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of spatio-temporal analysis, as it can generate substantial synthesized human mobility trajectories that enhance user privacy and alleviate data scarcity. However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Architecture for Trajectory-Based Fishing Ship Classification with AIS Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02038v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a data preparation process for managing real-world kinematic data and detecting fishing vessels. The solution is a binary classification that classifies ship trajectories into either fishing or non-fishing ships. The data used are characterized by the typical problems found in classic data mining applications using real-world data, such as noise and inconsistencies. The two classes are also clearly unbalanced in the data, a problem which is addressed using algorithms that resample the instances. For classification, a series of features are extracted from spatiotemporal data that represent the trajectories of the ships, available from sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports. These features are proposed for the modelling of ship behavior but, because they do not contain context-related information, the classification can be applied in other scenarios. Experimentation shows that the proposed data preparation process is useful for the presented classification problem. In addition, positive results are obtained using minimal information.</p></details> | Sensors 2020 |
| **[Enhancing Large Vision Model in Street Scene Semantic Understanding through Leveraging Posterior Optimization Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01710v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the generalization of the autonomous driving (AD) perception model, vehicles need to update the model over time based on the continuously collected data. As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v3)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Diffusion Policies for Generative Modeling of Spacecraft Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00915v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>AIAA ...</summary><p>AIAA SCITECH 2025 Forum</p></details> |

Though this technology plays a significant role in alleviating the prevalent operational difficulties in logistics and transportation systems, the precise prediction of vehicle trajectories still poses a substantial challenge. To address this, our study introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs). The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise vehicle trajectory prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets. This is expected to establish STATVTPred as a new approach for handling trajectory prediction of targets in logistics and transportation scenarios, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification. Our model sets a new standard of performance on the MMUAD benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and effectiveness.

| **[Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12698v4)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |
| **[Trajectories of Change: Approaches for Tracking Knowledge Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00391v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore local vs. global evolution of knowledge systems through the framework of socio-epistemic networks (SEN), applying two complementary methods to a corpus of scientific texts. The framework comprises three interconnected layers-social, semiotic (material), and semantic-proposing a multilayered approach to understanding structural developments of knowledge. To analyse diachronic changes on the semantic layer, we first use information-theoretic measures based on relative entropy to detect semantic shifts, assess their significance, and identify key driving features. Second, variations in document embedding densities reveal changes in semantic neighbourhoods, tracking how concentration of similar documents increase, remain stable, or disperse. This enables us to trace document trajectories based on content (topics) or metadata (authorship, institution). Case studies of Joseph Silk and Hans-J\"urgen Treder illustrate how individual scholar's work aligns with broader disciplinary shifts in general relativity and gravitation research, demonstrating the applications, limitations, and further potential of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajLearn: Trajectory Prediction Learning using Deep Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00184v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> |  |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters) with low computation times (milliseconds).</p></details> | V1 Draft |

Trajectory prediction spans both short-term and long-term horizons, each requiring distinct considerations: short-term predictions rely on accurately capturing the vehicle's dynamics, while long-term predictions rely on accurately modeling the interaction patterns within the environment. However current approaches, either physics-based or learning-based models, always ignore these distinct considerations, making them struggle to find the optimal prediction for both short-term and long-term horizon. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics-Enhanced Learning MOdel (DEMO), a novel approach that combines a physics-based Vehicle Dynamics Model with advanced deep learning algorithms. DEMO employs a two-stage architecture, featuring a Dynamics Learning Stage and an Interaction Learning Stage, where the former stage focuses on capturing vehicle motion dynamics and the latter focuses on modeling interaction. By capitalizing on the respective strengths of both methods, DEMO facilitates multi-horizon predictions for future trajectories. Experimental results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Macau Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD), Highway Drone (HighD), and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that DEMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both short-term and long-term prediction horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</p></details> |  |

| **[Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11238v2)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches. The paper also provides an in-depth analysis of the multi-modal funnel structure of a low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 23 figures, initial content of this paper appears in Paper 23-352 at the AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, August 13-17 2023</p></details> |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[TrajGEOS: Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential Network for Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19092v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

| **[Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalTAD: Causal Implicit Generative Model for Debiased Online Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18820v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection, aiming to estimate the anomaly risk of trajectories given the Source-Destination (SD) pairs, has become a critical problem for many real-world applications. Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Trajectories: Linking Sampling Process to Artifacts in Diffusion-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17109v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact detection algorithms are crucial to correcting the output generated by diffusion models. However, because of the variety of artifact forms, existing methods require substantial annotated data for training. This requirement limits their scalability and efficiency, which restricts their wide application. This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between consecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity of artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize the sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented. Using an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of data used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to predict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation testing on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an accuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity Trajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables differentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12369v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper comprises 20 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm, and 1 appendix.

| **[Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

| **[Choice Between Partial Trajectories: Disentangling Goals from Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Efficient Representation Learning for Flight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16581v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory data plays a vital role in the traffic management community, especially for downstream tasks such as trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection. Existing works often utilize handcrafted features and design models for different tasks individually, which heavily rely on domain expertise and are hard to extend. We argue that different flight analysis tasks share the same useful features of the trajectory. Jointly learning a unified representation for flight trajectories could be beneficial for improving the performance of various tasks. However, flight trajectory representation learning (TRL) faces two primary challenges, \ie unbalanced behavior density and 3D spatial continuity, which disable recent general TRL methods. In this paper, we propose Flight2Vec , a flight-specific representation learning method to address these challenges. Specifically, a behavior-adaptive patching mechanism is used to inspire the learned representation to pay more attention to behavior-dense segments. Moreover, we introduce a motion trend learning technique that guides the model to memorize not only the precise locations, but also the motion trend to generate better representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Flight2Vec significantly improves performance in downstream tasks such as flight trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Aligned Network for Generalized Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05810v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial component in computer vision and robotics, but remains challenging due to the domain shift problem. Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target domain to adapt the model. However, such domain adaptation methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target domains. In this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen domains without accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the domain gap through domain alignment. Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

This framework consists of three modular components, i.e., a planner, trajectory generator, and controller defined on the manifold. All components are computationally efficient, compact, and branchless, and an encoder can be used to interface existing framework components that are not based on Clarke coordinates. We derive the relationship between the kinematic constraints in the joint space and on the manifold to generate smooth trajectories on the manifold. Furthermore, we establish the connection between the displacement constraint and parallel curves. To demonstrate its effectiveness, a demonstration in simulation for a displacement-actuated continuum robot with four segments is presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time. By coupling satisfiability modulo theories with set-based reachability analysis, we determine if and in what manner the initial trajectory can be repaired. Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE.

| **[Learning Group Interactions and Semantic Intentions for Multi-Object Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15673v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective modeling of group interactions and dynamic semantic intentions is crucial for forecasting behaviors like trajectories or movements. In complex scenarios like sports, agents' trajectories are influenced by group interactions and intentions, including team strategies and opponent actions. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that integrates group-level interactions into a conditional diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse trajectories aligned with specific group activity. To capture dynamic semantic intentions, we frame group interaction prediction as a cooperative game, using Banzhaf interaction to model cooperation trends. We then fuse semantic intentions with enhanced agent embeddings, which are refined through both global and local aggregation. Furthermore, we expand the NBA SportVU dataset by adding human annotations of team-level tactics for trajectory and tactic prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on three widely-adopted datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AdaFold extracts a particle-based representation of cloth from RGB-D images and feeds back the representation to a model predictive control to replan folding trajectory at every time step. A key component of AdaFold that enables feedback-loop manipulation is the use of semantic descriptors extracted from geometric features.

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[LeviTor: 3D Trajectory Oriented Image-to-Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15214v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intuitive nature of drag-based interaction has led to its growing adoption for controlling object trajectories in image-to-video synthesis. Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dubbed LeviTor, in precisely manipulating the object movements when producing photo-realistic videos from static images.

| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |
| **[Tracing the Roots: Leveraging Temporal Dynamics in Diffusion Trajectories for Origin Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07449v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized image synthesis, garnering significant research interest in recent years. Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder controls the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Accuracy Model Predictive Control with Inverse Hysteresis for High-Speed Trajectory Tracking of Piezoelectric Fast Steering Mirror](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14511v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Piezoelectric fast steering mirrors (PFSM) are widely utilized in beam precision-pointing systems but encounter considerable challenges in achieving high-precision tracking of fast trajectories due to nonlinear hysteresis and mechanical dual-axis cross-coupling. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) approach integrated with a hysteresis inverse based on the Hammerstein modeling structure of the PFSM. The MPC is designed to decouple the rate-dependent dual-axis linear components, with an augmented error integral variable introduced in the state space to eliminate steady-state errors. Moreover, proofs of zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection are provided. The hysteresis inverse model is then cascaded to compensate for the rate-independent nonlinear components. Finally, PFSM tracking experiments are conducted on step, sinusoidal, triangular, and composite trajectories. Compared to traditional model-free and existing model-based controllers, the proposed method significantly enhances tracking accuracy, demonstrating superior tracking performance and robustness to frequency variations. These results offer valuable insights for engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPN: An Ego Vehicle Planning-Informed Network for Target Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14442v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, serving as an intermediate link between perception and planning. However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. Current trajectory prediction methods typically use the historical trajectory and vehicle attributes as inputs, focusing primarily on how historical information influences the future trajectory of the target vehicle. In real-world driving scenarios, however, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical data but also by the behavior of other vehicles on the road. To address this, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between the ego vehicle's planned trajectory and the predicted trajectory of the target vehicle. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose a target's endpoint prediction module. This module first predicts the possible endpoints of the target vehicle, then refines these predictions through a correction mechanism, and finally generates a complete multimodal predicted trajectory based on the corrected endpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other trajectory prediction methods, EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE evaluation metrics on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset. These results highlight the strong performance of EPN in trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

Factors such as demographics, genetic conditions, and lifestyle contribute to diverse phenotypical manifestations, necessitating patient stratification based on these variations. Recent methods like Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) have advanced unsupervised stratification of disease trajectories, but they face potential limitations in robustness, interpretability, and temporal granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce Disease Progression Modelling and Stratification (DP-MoSt), a novel probabilistic method that optimises clusters of continuous trajectories over a long-term disease time-axis while estimating the confidence of trajectory sub-types for each biomarker. We validate DP-MoSt using both synthetic and real-world data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Our results demonstrate that DP-MoSt effectively identifies both sub-trajectories and subpopulations, and is a promising alternative to current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Longi...</summary><p>Longitudinal Disease Tracking and Modelling with Medical Images and Data, Oct 2024, Marrachech, Morocco</p></details> |

This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</p></details> | 47 pages |

Our method integrates the foundation models CLIPSeg and Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the interest point detector SuperPoint and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to accurately segment machinery parts. By providing 1 to 25 annotated samples, our model, evaluated on a purely synthetic dataset depicting a truck-mounted loading crane, achieves effective segmentation across various levels of detail. Training times are kept under five minutes on consumer GPUs. The model demonstrates robust generalization to real data, achieving a qualitative synthetic-to-real generalization with a $J\&F$ score of 92.2 on real data using 10 synthetic support samples. When benchmarked on the DAVIS 2017 dataset, it achieves a $J\&F$ score of 71.5 in semi-supervised video segmentation with three support samples. This method's fast training times and effective generalization to real data make it a valuable tool for autonomous systems interacting with machinery and infrastructure, and illustrate the potential of combined and orchestrated foundation models for few-shot segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025.

While traditional spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in short-term traffic forecasting, their performance in long-term predictions remains limited. This challenge arises from over-squashing problem, where bottlenecks and limited receptive fields restrict information flow and hinder the modeling of global dependencies. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework that incorporates virtual nodes, which are additional nodes added to the graph and connected to existing nodes, in order to aggregate information across the entire graph within a single GNN layer. Our proposed model incorporates virtual nodes by constructing a semi-adaptive adjacency matrix. This matrix integrates distance-based and adaptive adjacency matrices, allowing the model to leverage geographical information while also learning task-specific features from data. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of virtual nodes significantly enhances long-term prediction accuracy while also improving layer-wise sensitivity to mitigate the over-squashing problem. Virtual nodes also offer enhanced explainability by focusing on key intersections and high-traffic areas, as shown by the visualization of their adjacency matrix weights on road network heat maps. Our advanced approach enhances the understanding and management of urban traffic systems, making it particularly well-suited for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Graph Representations and Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08305v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) enables the analysis if complex temporal data, and thus serves as a cornerstone in various real-world applications, ranging from healthcare to finance. Since the relationship among variables in MTS usually contain crucial cues, a large number of graph-based MTSC approaches have been proposed, as the graph topology and edges can explicitly represent relationships among variables (channels), where not only various MTS graph representation learning strategies but also different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been explored. Despite such progresses, there is no comprehensive study that fairly benchmarks and investigates the performances of existing widely-used graph representation learning strategies/GNN classifiers in the application of different MTSC tasks. In this paper, we present the first benchmark which systematically investigates the effectiveness of the widely-used three node feature definition strategies, four edge feature learning strategies and five GNN architecture, resulting in 60 different variants for graph-based MTSC. These variants are developed and evaluated with a standardized data pipeline and training/validation/testing strategy on 26 widely-used suspensor MTSC datasets. Our experiments highlight that node features significantly influence MTSC performance, while the visualization of edge features illustrates why adaptive edge learning outperforms other edge feature learning methods.

| **[RELIEF: Reinforcement Learning Empowered Graph Feature Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03195v3)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of the "pre-train, prompt" paradigm has recently extended its generalization ability and data efficiency to graph representation learning, following its achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.

Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions are employed to discretely and accurately represent the geometry of 3D conducting bodies. A concise and informative graph representation is then constructed by treating each RWG function as a node in the graph, enabling the flow of current between nodes. With the transformed graphs, GraphSolver is developed to directly predict real and imaginary parts of the x, y and z components of the surface current densities at each node (RWG function). Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of GraphSolver in solving CFIEs for 3D conducting bodies with varying levels of geometric complexity, including basic 3D targets, missile-shaped targets, and airplane-shaped targets.</p></details> | 10 pages,11 figures |

By leveraging a Bayesian non-parametric framework, BN-Pool employs a generative model capable of partitioning graph nodes into an unbounded number of clusters. During training, we learn the node-to-cluster assignments by combining the supervised loss of the downstream task with an unsupervised auxiliary term, which encourages the reconstruction of the original graph topology while penalizing unnecessary proliferation of clusters. This adaptive strategy allows BN-Pool to automatically discover an optimal coarsening level, offering enhanced flexibility and removing the need to specify sensitive pooling ratios. We show that BN-Pool achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

One common approach is to use Dijkstra's Algorithm, which produces the shortest path as well as the shortest distance. However, this option is computationally expensive when applied to large-scale networks. This paper proposes a novel fast framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) which approximate the single-source shortest distance between pairs of locations, and predict the single-source shortest path subsequently. We conduct multiple experiments on synthetic graphs of different size to demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency of the proposed model. In real-world case studies, we also applied the proposed method of flood risk analysis of coastal urban areas to calculate delays in evacuation to public shelters during hurricanes. The results indicate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the GNN model, and its potential for effective implementation in emergency planning and management.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

However, unlike GNNs, FMs struggle to incorporate node features and generalise to unseen nodes in inductive settings. Our work bridges the gap between FMs and GNNs by proposing ReFactor GNNs. This new architecture draws upon both modelling paradigms, which previously were largely thought of as disjoint. Concretely, using a message-passing formalism, we show how FMs can be cast as GNNs by reformulating the gradient descent procedure as message-passing operations, which forms the basis of our ReFactor GNNs. Across a multitude of well-established KGC benchmarks, our ReFactor GNNs achieve comparable transductive performance to FMs, and state-of-the-art inductive performance while using an order of magnitude fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>36th ...</summary><p>36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022)</p></details> |

Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored.

To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter.

This paper proposes an EOC fast search method, named Graph Dueling Double Deep Q Network (Graph D3QN), which combines graph neural network and deep reinforcement learning to address this challenge. First, the EOC search problem is modeled as a Markov decision process, where the information of the underlying power system is extracted using graph neural networks, so that the EOC of the system can be found via deep reinforcement learning. Then, a two-stage Guided Learning and Free Exploration (GLFE) training framework is constructed to accelerate the convergence speed of reinforcement learning. Finally, the proposed Graph D3QN method is validated through case studies of searching maximum fault current for relay protection setting calculation on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems. The experimental results demonstrate that Graph D3QN can reduce the computation time by 10 to 1000 times while guaranteeing the accuracy of the selected EOCs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

In this work we equip its enumeration-based instantiation with a neural network that guides the choice of the quantified formulas and their instances. For that we develop a relatively fast graph neural network that repeatedly scores all available instantiation options with respect to the available formulas. The network runs directly on a CPU without the need for any special hardware.

| **[Mitigating Overfitting in Graph Neural Networks via Feature and Hyperplane Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15081v8)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly used in semi-supervised settings. Previous research has primarily focused on finding appropriate graph filters (e.g. aggregation methods) to perform well on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. While these methods are effective, they can still suffer from the sparsity of node features, where the initial data contain few non-zero elements. This can lead to overfitting in certain dimensions in the first projection matrix, as training samples may not cover the entire range of graph filters (hyperplanes). To address this, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy. Specifically, by flipping both the initial features and hyperplane, we create additional space for training, which leads to more precise updates of the learnable parameters and improved robustness for unseen features during inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to mitigate the overfitting caused by the initial features. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed technique increases node classification accuracy by up to 46.5% relatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothness Really Matters: A Simple Yet Effective Approach for Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11654v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) seeks to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. Existing UGDA methods primarily focus on aligning features in the latent space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs) across domains, often overlooking structural shifts, resulting in limited effectiveness when addressing structurally complex transfer scenarios. Given the sensitivity of GNNs to local structural features, even slight discrepancies between source and target graphs could lead to significant shifts in node embeddings, thereby reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach for UGDA called Target-Domain Structural Smoothing (TDSS). TDSS is a simple and effective method designed to perform structural smoothing directly on the target graph, thereby mitigating structural distribution shifts and ensuring the consistency of node representations. Specifically, by integrating smoothing techniques with neighborhood sampling, TDSS maintains the structural coherence of the target graph while mitigating the risk of over-smoothing. Our theoretical analysis shows that TDSS effectively reduces target risk by improving model smoothness. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that TDSS outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements across six transfer scenarios. The code is available in https://github.com/cwei01/TDSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, Accpected by AAAI2025</p></details> |

Graph neural networks, the dominant approach for graph representation learning, are limited in their representation power. Therefore, it can be beneficial to explicitly extract and incorporate high-order topological and geometric information into these models. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to extract the rich connectivity information of graphs based on the theory of persistent homology. Our method utilizes the topological features to enhance the representation learning of graph neural networks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various node classification and link prediction benchmarks. We also explore the option of end-to-end learning of the topological features, i.e., treating topological computation as a differentiable operator during learning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical study provide insights and potential guidelines for employing topological features in graph learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in JMLR 2025</p></details> |

In our research, we develop an innovative surrogate model for a traffic assignment when multi-class vehicles are involved. We do so by employing heterogeneous graph neural networks which use a multiple-view graph attention mechanism tailored to different vehicle classes, along with additional links connecting origin-destination pairs. We also integrate the node-based flow conservation law into the loss function. As a result, our model adheres to flow conservation while delivering highly accurate predictions for link flows and utilization ratios. Through numerical experiments conducted on urban transportation networks, we demonstrate that our model surpasses traditional neural network approaches in convergence speed and predictive accuracy in both user equilibrium and system optimal versions of traffic assignment.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce Similarity-Quantized Relative Learning (SQRL), a learning framework that reformulates molecular activity prediction as relative difference learning between structurally similar pairs of compounds. SQRL uses precomputed molecular similarities to enhance training of graph neural networks and other architectures, and significantly improves accuracy and generalization in low-data regimes common in drug discovery. We demonstrate its broad applicability and real-world potential through benchmarking on public datasets as well as proprietary industry data. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging similarity-aware relative differences provides an effective paradigm for molecular activity prediction.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+12...</summary><p>10+12 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Joint Detection and Decoding: A Graph Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08871v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Narrowing the performance gap between optimal and feasible detection in inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels, this paper proposes to use graph neural networks (GNNs) for detection that can also be used to perform joint detection and decoding (JDD). For detection, the GNN is build upon the factor graph representations of the channel, while for JDD, the factor graph is expanded by the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix (PCM) of the channel code, sharing the variable nodes (VNs). A particularly advantageous property of the GNN is a) the robustness against cycles in the factor graphs which is the main problem for sum-product algorithm (SPA)-based detection, and b) the robustness against channel state information (CSI) uncertainty at the receiver. Additionally, we propose using an input embedding resulting in a GNN independent of the channel impulse response (CIR). Consequently, a fully deep learning-based receiver enables joint optimization instead of individual optimization of the components, so-called end-to-end learning. Furthermore, we propose a parallel flooding schedule that also reduces the latency, which turns out to improve the error correcting performance. The proposed approach is analyzed and compared to state-of-the-art baselines for different modulations and codes in terms of error correcting capability and latency. The gain compared to SPA-based detection might be explained with improved messages between nodes and adaptive damping of messages. For a higher order modulation in a high-rate turbo detection and decoding (TDD) scenario the GNN shows a, at first glance, surprisingly high gain of 6.25 dB compared to the best, feasible non-neural baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transactions on Communications. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.16187</p></details> |

By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this, we have developed GRAPPA - a hybrid graph neural network for predicting vapor pressures of pure components. GRAPPA enables the prediction of the vapor pressure curve of basically any organic molecule, requiring only the molecular structure as input. The new model consists of three parts: A graph attention network for the message passing step, a pooling function that captures long-range interactions, and a prediction head that yields the component-specific parameters of the Antoine equation, from which the vapor pressure can readily and consistently be calculated for any temperature. We have trained and evaluated GRAPPA on experimental vapor pressure data of almost 25,000 pure components. We found excellent prediction accuracy for unseen components, outperforming state-of-the-art group contribution methods and other machine learning approaches in applicability and accuracy. The trained model and its code are fully disclosed, and GRAPPA is directly applicable via the interactive website ml-prop.mv.rptu.de.</p></details> | 38 pages, 12 figures |

However, there is a noticeable absence of research on applying GNNs to supply chain networks. Supply chain networks are inherently graph-like in structure, making them prime candidates for applying GNN methodologies. This opens up a world of possibilities for optimizing, predicting, and solving even the most complex supply chain problems. A major setback in this approach lies in the absence of real-world benchmark datasets to facilitate the research and resolution of supply chain problems using GNNs. To address the issue, we present a real-world benchmark dataset for temporal tasks, obtained from one of the leading FMCG companies in Bangladesh, focusing on supply chain planning for production purposes. The dataset includes temporal data as node features to enable sales predictions, production planning, and the identification of factory issues. By utilizing this dataset, researchers can employ GNNs to address numerous supply chain problems, thereby advancing the field of supply chain analytics and planning.

| **[Dynamic Localisation of Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04239v3)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal data, fundamental to many intelligent applications, reveals dependencies indicating causal links between present measurements at specific locations and historical data at the same or other locations. Within this context, adaptive spatial-temporal graph neural networks (ASTGNNs) have emerged as valuable tools for modelling these dependencies, especially through a data-driven approach rather than pre-defined spatial graphs. While this approach offers higher accuracy, it presents increased computational demands. Addressing this challenge, this paper delves into the concept of localisation within ASTGNNs, introducing an innovative perspective that spatial dependencies should be dynamically evolving over time. We introduce \textit{DynAGS}, a localised ASTGNN framework aimed at maximising efficiency and accuracy in distributed deployment. This framework integrates dynamic localisation, time-evolving spatial graphs, and personalised localisation, all orchestrated around the Dynamic Graph Generator, a light-weighted central module leveraging cross attention. The central module can integrate historical information in a node-independent manner to enhance the feature representation of nodes at the current moment. This improved feature representation is then used to generate a dynamic sparse graph without the need for costly data exchanges, and it supports personalised localisation. Performance assessments across two core ASTGNN architectures and nine real-world datasets from various applications reveal that \textit{DynAGS} outshines current benchmarks, underscoring that the dynamic modelling of spatial dependencies can drastically improve model expressibility, flexibility, and system efficiency, especially in distributed settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by KDD'25</p></details> |
| **[Clarify Confused Nodes via Separated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02285v5)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in graph-oriented tasks. However, real-world graphs invariably contain a certain proportion of heterophilous nodes, challenging the homophily assumption of traditional GNNs and hindering their performance. Most existing studies continue to design generic models with shared weights between heterophilous and homophilous nodes. Despite the incorporation of high-order messages or multi-channel architectures, these efforts often fall short. A minority of studies attempt to train different node groups separately but suffer from inappropriate separation metrics and low efficiency. In this paper, we first propose a new metric, termed Neighborhood Confusion (NC), to facilitate a more reliable separation of nodes. We observe that node groups with different levels of NC values exhibit certain differences in intra-group accuracy and visualized embeddings. These pave the way for Neighborhood Confusion-guided Graph Convolutional Network (NCGCN), in which nodes are grouped by their NC values and accept intra-group weight sharing and message passing. Extensive experiments on both homophilous and heterophilous benchmarks demonstrate that our framework can effectively separate nodes and yield significant performance improvement compared to the latest methods.

However, most existing GNNs rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data for training, which is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain knowledge. In this paper, we first analyze the restrictions of GNNs generalization from the perspective of supervision signals in the context of few-shot semi-supervised node classification. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm named NormProp, which utilizes the homophily assumption of unlabeled nodes to generate additional supervision signals, thereby enhancing the generalization against label scarcity. The key idea is to efficiently capture both the class information and the consistency of aggregation during message passing, via decoupling the direction and Euclidean norm of node representations. Moreover, we conduct a theoretical analysis to determine the upper bound of Euclidean norm, and then propose homophilous regularization to constraint the consistency of unlabeled nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NormProp achieve state-of-the-art performance under low-label rate scenarios with low computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, serving GNNs on large graphs is challenging due to the high communication, computation, and memory overheads of constructing and executing computation graphs, which represent information flow across large neighborhoods. Existing approximation techniques in training can mitigate the overheads but, in serving, still lead to high latency and/or accuracy loss. To this end, we propose OMEGA, a system that enables low-latency GNN serving for large graphs with minimal accuracy loss through two key ideas. First, OMEGA employs selective recomputation of precomputed embeddings, which allows for reusing precomputed computation subgraphs while selectively recomputing a small fraction to minimize accuracy loss. Second, we develop computation graph parallelism, which reduces communication overhead by parallelizing the creation and execution of computation graphs across machines. Our evaluation with large graph datasets and GNN models shows that OMEGA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Automata Embeddings for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00205v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning is a powerful way to control an AI agent's behavior at runtime. That said, popular goal representations, e.g., target states or natural language, are either limited to Markovian tasks or rely on ambiguous task semantics. We propose representing temporal goals using compositions of deterministic finite automata (cDFAs) and use cDFAs to guide RL agents. cDFAs balance the need for formal temporal semantics with ease of interpretation: if one can understand a flow chart, one can understand a cDFA. On the other hand, cDFAs form a countably infinite concept class with Boolean semantics, and subtle changes to the automaton can result in very different tasks, making them difficult to condition agent behavior on. To address this, we observe that all paths through a DFA correspond to a series of reach-avoid tasks and propose pre-training graph neural network embeddings on "reach-avoid derived" DFAs. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed pre-training method enables zero-shot generalization to various cDFA task classes and accelerated policy specialization without the myopic suboptimality of hierarchical methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predict Confidently, Predict Right: Abstention in Dynamic Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08397v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world systems can be modeled as dynamic graphs, where nodes and edges evolve over time, requiring specialized models to capture their evolving dynamics in risk-sensitive applications effectively. Temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) are one such category of specialized models. For the first time, our approach integrates a reject option strategy within the framework of GNNs for continuous-time dynamic graphs. This allows the model to strategically abstain from making predictions when the uncertainty is high and confidence is low, thus minimizing the risk of critical misclassification and enhancing the results and reliability. We propose a coverage-based abstention prediction model to implement the reject option that maximizes prediction within a specified coverage. It improves the prediction score for link prediction and node classification tasks. Temporal GNNs deal with extremely skewed datasets for the next state prediction or node classification task. In the case of class imbalance, our method can be further tuned to provide a higher weightage to the minority class. Exhaustive experiments are presented on four datasets for dynamic link prediction and two datasets for dynamic node classification tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving the reliability and area under the curve (AUC)/ average precision (AP) scores for predictions in dynamic graph scenarios. The results highlight our model's ability to efficiently handle the trade-offs between prediction confidence and coverage, making it a dependable solution for applications requiring high precision in dynamic and uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |

The Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network (KAN) has recently emerged as an alternative to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), offering better accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters. KANs have been applied to GNN tasks. This paper introduces the integration of KANs into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs). We evaluate KAN-enhanced SGCNs (KASGCN) on signed community detection and link sign prediction tasks to improve embedding quality in signed networks. While the results show some variability, KASGCN performs competitively with or similarly to the standard SGCN in the functions tested. Its effectiveness depends on the specific context, such as the signed graph and parameter settings.</p></details> |  |

This task presents greater challenges than traditional inductive link prediction tasks with only new nodes, as models must be capable of zero-shot generalization to both unseen nodes and unseen relation types in the inference graph. Despite the development of novel models, a unifying theoretical understanding of their success remains elusive, and the limitations of these methods are not well-studied. In this work, we introduce the concept of double permutation-equivariant representations and demonstrate its necessity for effective performance in this task. We show that many existing models, despite their diverse architectural designs, conform to this framework. However, we also identify inherent limitations in double permutation-equivariant representations, which restrict these models's ability to learn effectively on datasets with varying characteristics. Our findings suggest that while double equivariance is necessary for meta-learning across knowledge graphs from different domains, it is not sufficient. There remains a fundamental gap between double permutation-equivariant models and the concept of foundation models designed to learn patterns across all domains.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches to VAD often rely on finetuning large pre-trained models, which can be computationally expensive and impractical for real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address this, MissionGNN introduced a more efficient method by training a graph neural network (GNN) using a fixed knowledge graph (KG) derived from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. While this approach demonstrated significant efficiency in computational power and memory, it faces limitations in dynamic environments where frequent updates to the KG are necessary due to evolving behavior trends and shifting data patterns. These updates typically require cloud-based computation, posing challenges for edge computing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that facilitates continuous KG adaptation directly on edge devices, overcoming the limitations of cloud dependency. Our method dynamically modifies the KG through a three-phase process: pruning, alternating, and creating nodes, enabling real-time adaptation to changing data trends. This continuous learning approach enhances the robustness of anomaly detection models, making them more suitable for deployment in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |

Comprehending user emotions can provide valuable insights for improving communication and understanding of human behaviors. Despite significant advancements in Affective Computing, the diverse factors influencing user emotions in social networks remain relatively understudied. Moreover, there is a notable lack of deep learning-based methods for predicting user emotions in social networks, which could be addressed by leveraging the extensive multimodal data available. This work presents a novel formulation of personalized emotion prediction in social networks based on heterogeneous graph learning. Building upon this formulation, we design HMG-Emo, a Heterogeneous Multimodal Graph Learning Framework that utilizes deep learning-based features for user emotion recognition. Additionally, we include a dynamic context fusion module in HMG-Emo that is capable of adaptively integrating the different modalities in social media data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HMG-Emo and verify the superiority of adopting a graph neural network-based approach, which outperforms existing baselines that use rich hand-crafted features. To the best of our knowledge, HMG-Emo is the first multimodal and deep-learning-based approach to predict personalized emotions within online social networks. Our work highlights the significance of exploiting advanced deep learning techniques for less-explored problems in Affective Computing.</p></details> |  |

Traditional physics-based models face scalability challenges and are computationally demanding, while data-driven approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often lack physical consistency, interpretability, and generalization. In this paper, we propose Dynami-CAL GraphNet, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network that integrates the learning capabilities of GNNs with physics-based inductive biases to address these limitations. Dynami-CAL GraphNet enforces pairwise conservation of linear and angular momentum for interacting nodes using edge-local reference frames that are equivariant to rotational symmetries, invariant to translations, and equivariant to node permutations. This design ensures physically consistent predictions of node dynamics while offering interpretable, edge-wise linear and angular impulses resulting from pairwise interactions. Evaluated on a 3D granular system with inelastic collisions, Dynami-CAL GraphNet demonstrates stable error accumulation over extended rollouts, effective extrapolations to unseen configurations, and robust handling of heterogeneous interactions and external forces. Dynami-CAL GraphNet offers significant advantages in fields requiring accurate, interpretable, and real-time modeling of complex multi-body dynamical systems, such as robotics, aerospace engineering, and materials science. By providing physically consistent and scalable predictions that adhere to fundamental conservation laws, it enables the inference of forces and moments while efficiently handling heterogeneous interactions and external forces.</p></details> |  |

The SProp GNN shows performance superior to lexicon-based alternatives such as VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) and EmoAtlas on two different prediction tasks, and across two languages. Additionally, it approaches the accuracy of transformer-based models while significantly reducing bias in emotion prediction tasks. By offering improved explainability and reducing bias, the SProp GNN bridges the methodological gap between interpretable lexicon approaches and powerful, yet often opaque, deep learning models, offering a robust tool for fair and effective emotion analysis in understanding human behavior through text.</p></details> |  |

While many existing studies improve fairness at the group level, only a few works promote individual fairness, which renders similar outcomes for similar individuals. A desirable framework that promotes individual fairness should (1) balance between fairness and performance, (2) accommodate two commonly-used individual similarity measures (externally annotated and computed from input features), (3) generalize across various GNN models, and (4) be computationally efficient. Unfortunately, none of the prior work achieves all the desirables. In this work, we propose a novel method, GFairHint, which promotes individual fairness in GNNs and achieves all aforementioned desirables. GFairHint learns fairness representations through an auxiliary link prediction task, and then concatenates the representations with the learned node embeddings in original GNNs as a "fairness hint". Through extensive experimental investigations on five real-world graph datasets under three prevalent GNN models covering both individual similarity measures above, GFairHint achieves the best fairness results in almost all combinations of datasets with various backbone models, while generating comparable utility results, with much less computational cost compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable Graph Neural Networks for Robust Power Grid Topology Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07186v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The energy transition necessitates new congestion management methods. One such method is controlling the grid topology with machine learning (ML). This approach has gained popularity following the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of ML models that reflect graph structure in their computation, which makes them suitable for power grid modeling. Various GNN approaches for topology control have thus been proposed. We propose the first GNN model for grid topology control that uses only GNN layers. Additionally, we identify the busbar information asymmetry problem that the popular homogeneous graph representation suffers from, and propose a heterogeneous graph representation to resolve it. We train both homogeneous and heterogeneous GNNs and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) baselines on an imitation learning task. We evaluate the models according to their classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that the heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution networks, followed by the FCNNs, and lastly, the homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution networks than FCNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Duplex: Dual Prototype Learning for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07114v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to enable models to recognize novel compositions of visual states and objects that were absent during training. Existing methods predominantly focus on learning semantic representations of seen compositions but often fail to disentangle the independent features of states and objects in images, thereby limiting their ability to generalize to unseen compositions. To address this challenge, we propose Duplex, a novel dual-prototype learning method that integrates semantic and visual prototypes through a carefully designed dual-branch architecture, enabling effective representation learning for compositional tasks. Duplex utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to adaptively update visual prototypes, capturing complex interactions between states and objects. Additionally, it leverages the strong visual-semantic alignment of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a multi-path architecture combined with prompt engineering to align image and text representations, ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Duplex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed-world and open-world settings.</p></details> |  |

The utilization of graph-based structures, such as bipartite graphs, has gained popularity for their ability to analyze complex data relationships. Link prediction is crucial for recommending specific items to users. Traditional methods in this area often involve identifying patterns in the graph structure or using representational techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs). However, these approaches encounter difficulties as the volume of data increases. To address these challenges, we propose a model called Graph Contrastive Learning for Multi-label Classification (MCGCL). MCGCL leverages contrastive learning to enhance recommendation effectiveness. The model incorporates two training stages: a main task and a subtask. The main task is holistic user-item graph learning to capture user-item relationships. The homogeneous user-user (item-item) subgraph is constructed to capture user-user and item-item relationships in the subtask. We assessed the performance using real-world datasets from Amazon Reviews in multi-label classification tasks. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods confirm the effectiveness of MCGCL, highlighting its potential for improving recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Property Encoder for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11554v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph machine learning, particularly using graph neural networks, fundamentally relies on node features. Nevertheless, numerous real-world systems, such as social and biological networks, often lack node features due to various reasons, including privacy concerns, incomplete or missing data, and limitations in data collection. In such scenarios, researchers typically resort to methods like structural and positional encoding to construct node features. However, the length of such features is contingent on the maximum value within the property being encoded, for example, the highest node degree, which can be exceedingly large in applications like scale-free networks. Furthermore, these encoding schemes are limited to categorical data and might not be able to encode metrics returning other type of values. In this paper, we introduce a novel, universally applicable encoder, termed \emph{PropEnc}, which constructs expressive node embedding from any given graph metric. \emph{PropEnc} leverages histogram construction combined with reversed index encoding, offering a flexible method for node features initialization. It supports flexible encoding in terms of both dimensionality and type of input, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse applications. \emph{PropEnc} allows encoding metrics in low-dimensional space which effectively address the sparsity challenge and enhances the efficiency of the models. We show that \emph{PropEnc} can construct node features that either exactly replicate one-hot encoding or closely approximate indices under various settings. Our extensive evaluations in graph classification setting across multiple social networks that lack node features support our hypothesis. The empirical results conclusively demonstrate that \emph{PropEnc} is both an efficient and effective mechanism for constructing node features from diverse set of graph metrics.</p></details> | conference paper |
| **[Neural Bayes Estimators for Irregular Spatial Data using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02600v3)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Bayes estimators are neural networks that approximate Bayes estimators in a fast and likelihood-free manner. Although they are appealing to use with spatial models, where estimation is often a computational bottleneck, neural Bayes estimators in spatial applications have, to date, been restricted to data collected over a regular grid. These estimators are also currently dependent on a prescribed set of spatial locations, which means that the neural network needs to be re-trained for new data sets; this renders them impractical in many applications and impedes their widespread adoption. In this work, we employ graph neural networks to tackle the important problem of parameter point estimation from data collected over arbitrary spatial locations. In addition to extending neural Bayes estimation to irregular spatial data, our architecture leads to substantial computational benefits, since the estimator can be used with any configuration or number of locations and independent replicates, thus amortising the cost of training for a given spatial model. We also facilitate fast uncertainty quantification by training an accompanying neural Bayes estimator that approximates a set of marginal posterior quantiles. We illustrate our methodology on Gaussian and max-stable processes. Finally, we showcase our methodology on a data set of global sea-surface temperature, where we estimate the parameters of a Gaussian process model in 2161 spatial regions, each containing thousands of irregularly-spaced data points, in just a few minutes with a single graphics processing unit.</p></details> |  |

However, their vulnerability to model stealing attacks when deployed within Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) necessitates robust Ownership Demonstration (OD) techniques. Watermarking is a promising OD framework for Deep Neural Networks, but existing methods fail to generalize to GNNs due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data. Previous works on GNN watermarking have primarily focused on node and graph classification, overlooking Link Prediction (LP). In this paper, we propose GENIE (watermarking Graph nEural Networks for lInk prEdiction), the first-ever scheme to watermark GNNs for LP. GENIE creates a novel backdoor for both node-representation and subgraph-based LP methods, utilizing a unique trigger set and a secret watermark vector. Our OD scheme is equipped with Dynamic Watermark Thresholding (DWT), ensuring high verification probability (>99.99%) while addressing practical issues in existing watermarking schemes. We extensively evaluate GENIE across 4 model architectures (i.e., SEAL, GCN, GraphSAGE and NeoGNN) and 7 real-world datasets. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of GENIE against 11 state-of-the-art watermark removal techniques and 3 model extraction attacks. We also show GENIE's resilience against ownership piracy attacks. Finally, we discuss a defense strategy to counter adaptive attacks against GENIE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba Meets Financial Markets: A Graph-Mamba Approach for Stock Price Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03707v2)** | 2025-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock markets play an important role in the global economy, where accurate stock price predictions can lead to significant financial returns. While existing transformer-based models have outperformed long short-term memory networks and convolutional neural networks in financial time series prediction, their high computational complexity and memory requirements limit their practicality for real-time trading and long-sequence data processing. To address these challenges, we propose SAMBA, an innovative framework for stock return prediction that builds on the Mamba architecture and integrates graph neural networks. SAMBA achieves near-linear computational complexity by utilizing a bidirectional Mamba block to capture long-term dependencies in historical price data and employing adaptive graph convolution to model dependencies between daily stock features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAMBA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction accuracy, maintaining low computational complexity.

| **[Dual-Modality Representation Learning for Molecular Property Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06608v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction has attracted substantial attention recently. Accurate prediction of drug properties relies heavily on effective molecular representations. The structures of chemical compounds are commonly represented as graphs or SMILES sequences. Recent advances in learning drug properties commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on the graph representation. For the SMILES representation, Transformer-based architectures have been adopted by treating each SMILES string as a sequence of tokens. Because each representation has its own advantages and disadvantages, combining both representations in learning drug properties is a promising direction. We propose a method named Dual-Modality Cross-Attention (DMCA) that can effectively combine the strengths of two representations by employing the cross-attention mechanism. DMCA was evaluated across eight datasets including both classification and regression tasks. Results show that our method achieves the best overall performance, highlighting its effectiveness in leveraging the complementary information from both graph and SMILES modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Computational Capability of Graph Neural Networks: A Circuit Complexity Bound Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06444v1)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the standard approach for learning and reasoning over relational data, leveraging the message-passing mechanism that iteratively propagates node embeddings through graph structures. While GNNs have achieved significant empirical success, their theoretical limitations remain an active area of research. Existing studies primarily focus on characterizing GNN expressiveness through Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism tests. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach by exploring the computational limitations of GNNs through the lens of circuit complexity. Specifically, we analyze the circuit complexity of common GNN architectures and prove that under constraints of constant-depth layers, linear or sublinear embedding sizes, and polynomial precision, GNNs cannot solve key problems such as graph connectivity and graph isomorphism unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$. These results reveal the intrinsic expressivity limitations of GNNs behind their empirical success and introduce a novel framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness that can be extended to a broader range of GNN models and graph decision problems.</p></details> |  |

Recent attention has pivoted towards more intricate structures, encompassing (1) static heterophilic graphs encountering the edge heterophily issue in the spatial domain and (2) event-based continuous graphs in the temporal domain. State-of-the-art (SOTA) has been concurrently addressing these two lines of work but tends to overlook the presence of heterophily in the temporal domain, constituting the temporal heterophily issue. Furthermore, we highlight that the edge heterophily issue and the temporal heterophily issue often co-exist in event-based continuous graphs, giving rise to the temporal edge heterophily challenge. To tackle this challenge, this paper first introduces the temporal edge heterophily measurement. Subsequently, we propose the Temporal Heterophilic Graph Convolutional Network (THeGCN), an innovative model that incorporates the low/high-pass graph signal filtering technique to accurately capture both edge (spatial) heterophily and temporal heterophily. Specifically, the THeGCN model consists of two key components: a sampler and an aggregator. The sampler selects events relevant to a node at a given moment. Then, the aggregator executes message-passing, encoding temporal information, node attributes, and edge attributes into node embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 real-world datasets validate the efficacy of THeGCN.</p></details> |  |

Significant efforts have been made to develop algorithms that efficiently locate transition states on potential energy surfaces. However, the computational cost of ab-initio potential energy surface evaluation limits the size of chemical systems that can routinely studied. In this work, we develop and fine-tune a graph neural network potential energy function suitable for describing organic chemical reactions and use it to rapidly identify transition state guess structures. We successfully refine guess structures and locate a transition state in each test system considered and reduce the average number of ab-initio calculations by 47% though use of the graph neural network potential energy function. Our results show that modern machine learning models have reached levels of reliability whereby they can be used to accelerate routine computational chemistry tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[The Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08235v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective machine learning models for many graph-related applications. Despite their empirical success, many research efforts focus on the theoretical limitations of GNNs, i.e., the GNNs expressive power. Early works in this domain mainly focus on studying the graph isomorphism recognition ability of GNNs, and recent works try to leverage the properties such as subgraph counting and connectivity learning to characterize the expressive power of GNNs, which are more practical and closer to real-world. However, no survey papers and open-source repositories comprehensively summarize and discuss models in this important direction. To fill the gap, we conduct a first survey for models for enhancing expressive power under different forms of definition. Concretely, the models are reviewed based on three categories, i.e., Graph feature enhancement, Graph topology enhancement, and GNNs architecture enhancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeltaGNN: Graph Neural Network with Information Flow Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06002v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular deep learning models designed to process graph-structured data through recursive neighborhood aggregations in the message passing process. When applied to semi-supervised node classification, the message-passing enables GNNs to understand short-range spatial interactions, but also causes them to suffer from over-smoothing and over-squashing. These challenges hinder model expressiveness and prevent the use of deeper models to capture long-range node interactions (LRIs) within the graph. Popular solutions for LRIs detection are either too expensive to process large graphs due to high time complexity or fail to generalize across diverse graph structures. To address these limitations, we propose a mechanism called \emph{information flow control}, which leverages a novel connectivity measure, called \emph{information flow score}, to address over-smoothing and over-squashing with linear computational overhead, supported by theoretical evidence. Finally, to prove the efficacy of our methodology we design DeltaGNN, the first scalable and generalizable approach for detecting long-range and short-range interactions. We benchmark our model across 10 real-world datasets, including graphs with varying sizes, topologies, densities, and homophilic ratios, showing superior performance with limited computational complexity. The implementation of the proposed methods are publicly available at https://github.com/basiralab/DeltaGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Heterogeneous Network learning with Non-Recursive Message Passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07598v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) can be used to model various real-world systems. As HINs consist of multiple types of nodes, edges, and node features, it is nontrivial to directly apply graph neural network (GNN) techniques in heterogeneous cases. There are two remaining major challenges. First, homogeneous message passing in a recursive manner neglects the distinct types of nodes and edges in different hops, leading to unnecessary information mixing. This often results in the incorporation of ``noise'' from uncorrelated intermediate neighbors, thereby degrading performance. Second, feature learning should be handled differently for different types, which is challenging especially when the type sizes are large. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel framework - AutoGNR, to directly utilize and automatically extract effective heterogeneous information. Instead of recursive homogeneous message passing, we introduce a non-recursive message passing mechanism for GNN to mitigate noise from uncorrelated node types in HINs. Furthermore, under the non-recursive framework, we manage to efficiently perform neural architecture search for an optimal GNN structure in a differentiable way, which can automatically define the heterogeneous paths for aggregation. Our tailored search space encompasses more effective candidates while maintaining a tractable size. Experiments show that AutoGNR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both normal and large scale real-world HIN datasets.</p></details> |  |

In parallel, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been recently adapted to solve combinatorial problems, showing competitive results and potentially high scalability due to their distributed nature. We propose a merging approach that aims at retaining both the accuracy exhibited by AMs and the representational flexibility and scalability of GNNs. Our model considers a compression step, followed by a supervised interaction where partial solutions obtained from the AM are used to guide local GNNs from where node feature representations are obtained and combined to initialize an additional GNN-based solver that handles the original graph's target problem. Intuitively, the AM can solve the combinatorial problem indirectly by infusing its knowledge into the GNN. Experiments on canonical optimization problems show that the idea is feasible, effectively allowing the AM to solve size problems beyond its original limits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second Workshop on Machine Learning with New Compute Paradigms at NeurIPS 2024 (MLNCP 2024)</p></details> |

However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of GNNs to backdoor attacks, which can lead the model to misclassify graphs with attached triggers as the target class. The effectiveness of recent promising defense techniques, such as fine-tuning or distillation, is heavily contingent on having comprehensive knowledge of the sufficient training dataset. Empirical studies have shown that fine-tuning methods require a clean dataset of 20% to reduce attack accuracy to below 25%, while distillation methods require a clean dataset of 15%. However, obtaining such a large amount of clean data is commonly impractical. In this paper, we propose a practical backdoor mitigation framework, denoted as GRAPHNAD, which can capture high-quality intermediate-layer representations in GNNs to enhance the distillation process with limited clean data. To achieve this, we address the following key questions: How to identify the appropriate attention representations in graphs for distillation? How to enhance distillation with limited data? By adopting the graph attention transfer method, GRAPHNAD can effectively align the intermediate-layer attention representations of the backdoored model with that of the teacher model, forcing the backdoor neurons to transform into benign ones. Besides, we extract the relation maps from intermediate-layer transformation and enforce the relation maps of the backdoored model to be consistent with that of the teacher model, thereby ensuring model accuracy while further reducing the influence of backdoors. Extensive experimental results show that by fine-tuning a teacher model with only 3% of the clean data, GRAPHNAD can reduce the attack success rate to below 5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02565v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI'25</p></details> |

This is because they rely either on single-agent perspectives or on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based planners, which are complex to optimize. These methods have proven to be computationally expensive and inefficient when dealing with a large number of agents. To address these limitations, we present a new scalable approach to multi-agent control in this setting. Our method treats the relationships between agents using a graph structure rather than in terms of a single-agent perspective. Moreover, it combines a multi-agent collision avoidance controller with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based planner, models the system in a decentralized fashion, and trains on STL-based objectives to generate safe and efficient plans for multiple agents, thereby optimizing the satisfaction of complex temporal specifications while also facilitating multi-agent collision avoidance. Our experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods that use a state-of-the-art MILP-based planner in terms of scalability and performance.

Backward contact tracing, which tracks the sources of infection, proved crucial in places like Japan for identifying COVID-19 infections from superspreading events. This paper presents a novel perspective of digital contact tracing as online graph exploration and addresses the forward and backward contact tracing problem as a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation problem using iterative epidemic network data sampling. The challenge lies in the combinatorial complexity and rapid spread of infections. We introduce DeepTrace, an algorithm based on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that iteratively updates its estimations as new contact tracing data is collected, learning to optimize the maximum likelihood estimation by utilizing topological features to accelerate learning and improve convergence. The contact tracing process combines either BFS or DFS to expand the network and trace the infection source, ensuring comprehensive and efficient exploration. Additionally, the GNN model is fine-tuned through a two-phase approach: pre-training with synthetic networks to approximate likelihood probabilities and fine-tuning with high-quality data to refine the model. Using COVID-19 variant data, we illustrate that DeepTrace surpasses current methods in identifying superspreaders, providing a robust basis for a scalable digital contact tracing strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks</p></details> |

However, protecting GNNs from unauthorized use remains a challenge. Watermarking, which embeds ownership information into a model, is a potential solution. However, existing watermarking methods have two key limitations: First, almost all of them focus on non-graph data, with watermarking GNNs for complex graph data largely unexplored. Second, the de facto backdoor-based watermarking methods pollute training data and induce ownership ambiguity through intentional misclassification. Our explanation-based watermarking inherits the strengths of backdoor-based methods (e.g., robust to watermark removal attacks), but avoids data pollution and eliminates intentional misclassification. In particular, our method learns to embed the watermark in GNN explanations such that this unique watermark is statistically distinct from other potential solutions, and ownership claims must show statistical significance to be verified. We theoretically prove that, even with full knowledge of our method, locating the watermark is an NP-hard problem. Empirically, our method manifests robustness to removal attacks like fine-tuning and pruning. By addressing these challenges, our approach marks a significant advancement in protecting GNN intellectual property.</p></details> |  |

However, most of these studies have not considered the skewed degree distribution of genes. Specifically, some genes may regulate multiple target genes while some genes may be regulated by multiple regulator genes. Such a skewed degree distribution issue significantly complicates the application of directed graph embedding methods. To tackle this issue, we propose the Cross-Attention Complex Dual Graph Embedding Model (XATGRN).

| **[Boosting Graph Neural Network Training by Focusing on Non-Robust Samples from the Training Set](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v5)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise from both the graph structure and data features, which can significantly increase the training difficulty and degrade their performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for selecting noise-sensitive training samples from the original training set to construct a smaller yet more effective training set for model training. These samples are then used to enhance the model's ability to handle noise-prone instances effectively. We have evaluated our approach on three of the most classical GNN models -- GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE -- as well as three widely used benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially boost the overall training of Graph Neural Networks compared to using randomly constructed training sets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods like YOLO11, while proficient in spatial feature extraction for precise detection, often struggle with these small and dynamically moving objects, particularly in handling real-time data updates and resource efficiency. This paper introduces DGNN-YOLO, a novel framework that integrates dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) with YOLO11 to address these limitations. Unlike standard GNNs, DGNNs are chosen for their superior ability to dynamically update graph structures in real-time, which enables adaptive and robust tracking of objects in highly variable urban traffic scenarios. This framework constructs and regularly updates its graph representations, capturing objects as nodes and their interactions as edges, thus effectively responding to rapidly changing conditions. Additionally, DGNN-YOLO incorporates Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM visualization techniques to enhance interpretability and foster trust, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. Extensive experiments validate the framework's performance, achieving a precision of 0.8382, recall of 0.6875, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.6476, significantly outperforming existing methods. This study offers a scalable and interpretable solution for real-time traffic surveillance and significantly advances intelligent transportation systems' capabilities by addressing the critical challenge of detecting and tracking small, occluded objects.</p></details> |  |

We introduce AskGNN, a novel approach that bridges this gap by leveraging In-Context Learning (ICL) to integrate graph data and task-specific information into LLMs. AskGNN employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-powered structure-enhanced retriever to select labeled nodes across graphs, incorporating complex graph structures and their supervision signals. Our learning-to-retrieve algorithm optimizes the retriever to select example nodes that maximize LLM performance on graph. Experiments across three tasks and seven LLMs demonstrate AskGNN's superior effectiveness in graph task performance, opening new avenues for applying LLMs to graph-structured data without extensive fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Graph Non-Contrastive Learning for Audio Deepfake Detection with Limited Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04942v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in audio deepfake detection have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal interdependencies in audio data, effectively identifying deepfake artifacts. However, the reliance of GNN-based methods on substantial labeled data for graph construction and robust performance limits their applicability in scenarios with limited labeled data. Although vast amounts of audio data exist, the process of labeling samples as genuine or fake remains labor-intensive and costly. To address this challenge, we propose SIGNL (Spatio-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a novel framework that maintains high GNN performance in low-label settings. SIGNL constructs spatio-temporal graphs by representing patches from the audio's visual spectrogram as nodes. These graph structures are modeled using vision graph convolutional (GC) encoders pre-trained through graph non-contrastive learning, a label-free that maximizes the similarity between positive pairs. The pre-trained encoders are then fine-tuned for audio deepfake detection, reducing reliance on labeled data. Experiments demonstrate that SIGNL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple audio deepfake detection datasets, achieving the lowest Equal Error Rate (EER) with as little as 5% labeled data. Additionally, SIGNL exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving the lowest EER in evaluations involving diverse attack types and languages in the In-The-Wild dataset.</p></details> |  |

Such graphs are typically known to be locally tree-like. We introduce a notion of Bayes optimality for node classification tasks, called asymptotic local Bayes optimality, and compute the optimal classifier according to this criterion for a fairly general statistical data model with arbitrary distributions of the node features and edge connectivity. The optimal classifier is implementable using a message-passing graph neural network architecture. We then compute the generalization error of this classifier and compare its performance against existing learning methods theoretically on a well-studied statistical model with naturally identifiable signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the data. We find that the optimal message-passing architecture interpolates between a standard MLP in the regime of low graph signal and a typical convolution in the regime of high graph signal. Furthermore, we prove a corresponding non-asymptotic result.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures, published at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

| **[Boosting Column Generation with Graph Neural Networks for Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03692v3)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing service schedules is pivotal to the reliable, efficient, and inclusive on-demand mobility. This pressing challenge is further exacerbated by the increasing needs of an aging population, the oversubscription of existing services, and the lack of effective solution methods. This study addresses the intricacies of service scheduling, by jointly optimizing rider trip planning and crew scheduling for a complex dynamic mobility service. The resulting optimization problems are extremely challenging computationally for state-of-the-art methods. To address this fundamental gap, this paper introduces the Joint Rider Trip Planning and Crew Shift Scheduling Problem (JRTPCSSP) and a novel solution method, called Attention and Gated GNN-Informed Column Generation (AGGNNI-CG), that hybridizes column generation and machine learning to obtain near-optimal solutions to the JRTPCSSP with real-life constraints of the application. The key idea of the machine-learning component is to dramatically reduce the number of paths to explore in the pricing problem, accelerating the most time-consuming component of the column generation. The machine learning component is a graph neural network with an attention mechanism and a gated architecture, which is particularly suited to cater for the different input sizes coming from daily operations. AGGNNI-CG has been applied to a challenging, real-world dataset from the Paratransit system of Chatham County in Georgia. It produces substantial improvements compared to the baseline column generation approach, which typically cannot produce high-quality feasible solutions in reasonable time on large-scale complex instances. AGGNNI-CG also produces significant improvements in service quality compared to the existing system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixture-of-Experts Graph Transformers for Interpretable Particle Collision Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03432v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Large Hadron Collider at CERN produces immense volumes of complex data from high-energy particle collisions, demanding sophisticated analytical techniques for effective interpretation. Neural Networks, including Graph Neural Networks, have shown promise in tasks such as event classification and object identification by representing collisions as graphs. However, while Graph Neural Networks excel in predictive accuracy, their "black box" nature often limits their interpretability, making it difficult to trust their decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a Graph Transformer model with Mixture-of-Expert layers to achieve high predictive performance while embedding interpretability into the architecture. By leveraging attention maps and expert specialization, the model offers insights into its internal decision-making, linking predictions to physics-informed features. We evaluate the model on simulated events from the ATLAS experiment, focusing on distinguishing rare Supersymmetric signal events from Standard Model background. Our results highlight that the model achieves competitive classification accuracy while providing interpretable outputs that align with known physics, demonstrating its potential as a robust and transparent tool for high-energy physics data analysis. This approach underscores the importance of explainability in machine learning methods applied to high energy physics, offering a path toward greater trust in AI-driven discoveries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Capacity of Graph Neural Networks for Branching Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07099v3)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to predict properties and heuristics of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and hence accelerate MILP solvers. This paper investigates the capacity of GNNs to represent strong branching (SB), the most effective yet computationally expensive heuristic employed in the branch-and-bound algorithm. In the literature, message-passing GNN (MP-GNN), as the simplest GNN structure, is frequently used as a fast approximation of SB and we find that not all MILPs's SB can be represented with MP-GNN. We precisely define a class of "MP-tractable" MILPs for which MP-GNNs can accurately approximate SB scores. Particularly, we establish a universal approximation theorem: for any data distribution over the MP-tractable class, there always exists an MP-GNN that can approximate the SB score with arbitrarily high accuracy and arbitrarily high probability, which lays a theoretical foundation of the existing works on imitating SB with MP-GNN. For MILPs without the MP-tractability, unfortunately, a similar result is impossible, which can be illustrated by two MILP instances with different SB scores that cannot be distinguished by any MP-GNN, regardless of the number of parameters. Recognizing this, we explore another GNN structure called the second-order folklore GNN (2-FGNN) that overcomes this limitation, and the aforementioned universal approximation theorem can be extended to the entire MILP space using 2-FGNN, regardless of the MP-tractability. A small-scale numerical experiment is conducted to directly validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Spectral Graph Neural Networks via Laplacian Sparsification: Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04570v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) play a pivotal role in graph-based tasks for their proficiency in representation learning. Among the various GNN methods, spectral GNNs employing polynomial filters have shown promising performance on tasks involving both homophilous and heterophilous graph structures. However, The scalability of spectral GNNs on large graphs is limited because they learn the polynomial coefficients through multiple forward propagation executions during forward propagation. Existing works have attempted to scale up spectral GNNs by eliminating the linear layers on the input node features, a change that can disrupt end-to-end training, potentially impact performance, and become impractical with high-dimensional input features. To address the above challenges, we propose "Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Laplacian Sparsification (SGNN-LS)", a novel graph spectral sparsification method to approximate the propagation patterns of spectral GNNs. We prove that our proposed method generates Laplacian sparsifiers that can approximate both fixed and learnable polynomial filters with theoretical guarantees. Our method allows the application of linear layers on the input node features, enabling end-to-end training as well as the handling of raw text features. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis on datasets spanning various graph scales and properties to demonstrate the superior efficiency and effectiveness of our method. The results show that our method yields superior results in comparison with the corresponding approximated base models, especially on dataset Ogbn-papers100M(111M nodes, 1.6B edges) and MAG-scholar-C (2.8M features).</p></details> |  |

In this work, we discuss the limitations of the Graph-Instructed (GI) layer, and we formalize a novel edge-wise GI (EWGI) layer. We discuss the advantages of the EWGI layer and we provide numerical evidence that EWGINNs perform better than GINNs over some graph-structured input data, like the ones inferred from the Barabasi-Albert graph, and improve the training regularization on graphs with chaotic connectivity, like the ones inferred from the Erdos-Renyi graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Radio Propagation Modeling using Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06236v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling radio propagation is essential for wireless network design and performance optimization. Traditional methods rely on physics models of radio propagation, which can be inaccurate or inflexible. In this work, we propose using graph neural networks to learn radio propagation behaviors directly from real-world network data. Our approach converts the radio propagation environment into a graph representation, with nodes corresponding to locations and edges representing spatial and ray-tracing relationships between locations. The graph is generated by converting images of the environment into a graph structure, with specific relationships between nodes. The model is trained on this graph representation, using sensor measurements as target data. We demonstrate that the graph neural network, which learns to predict radio propagation directly from data, achieves competitive performance compared to traditional heuristic models. This data-driven approach outperforms classic numerical solvers in terms of both speed and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply graph neural networks to real-world radio propagation data to generate coverage maps, enabling generative models of signal propagation with point measurements only.</p></details> |  |

This research introduces a novel approach by combining implicit user data, such as viewing percentages, with social network analysis to enhance personalization in VOD platforms. The methodology constructs user-item interaction graphs based on viewing patterns and applies centrality measures (degree, closeness, and betweenness) to identify important videos. Modularity-based clustering groups related content, enabling personalized recommendations. The system was evaluated on a documentary-focused VOD platform with 328 users over four months. Results showed significant improvements: a 63% increase in click-through rate (CTR), a 24% increase in view completion rate, and a 17% improvement in user satisfaction. The approach outperformed traditional methods like Naive Bayes and SVM. Future research should explore advanced techniques, such as matrix factorization models, graph neural networks, and hybrid approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering. Additionally, incorporating temporal models and addressing scalability challenges for large-scale platforms are essential next steps. This study contributes to the state of the art by introducing modularity-based clustering and ego-centric ranking methods to enhance personalization in video recommendations. The findings suggest that integrating network-based features and implicit feedback can significantly improve user engagement, offering a cost-effective solution for VOD platforms to enhance recommendation quality.</p></details> |  |

Our filter-combine framework parallels the popular aggregate-combine paradigm for graph neural networks (GNNs) and naturally suggests many interesting families of MNNs which can be interpreted as manifold analogues of various popular GNNs. We propose a method for implementing MFCNs on high-dimensional point clouds that relies on approximating an underlying manifold by a sparse graph. We then prove that our method is consistent in the sense that it converges to a continuum limit as the number of data points tends to infinity, and we numerically demonstrate its effectiveness on real-world and synthetic data sets.</p></details> |  |

Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we design a distributed framework for safe multi-agent control in large-scale environments with obstacles, where a large number of agents are required to maintain safety using only local information and reach their goal locations. We introduce a new class of certificates, termed graph control barrier function (GCBF), which are based on the well-established control barrier function theory for safety guarantees and utilize a graph structure for scalable and generalizable distributed control of MAS. We develop a novel theoretical framework to prove the safety of an arbitrary-sized MAS with a single GCBF. We propose a new training framework GCBF+ that uses graph neural networks to parameterize a candidate GCBF and a distributed control policy. The proposed framework is distributed and is capable of taking point clouds from LiDAR, instead of actual state information, for real-world robotic applications. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method through various hardware experiments on a swarm of drones with objectives ranging from exchanging positions to docking on a moving target without collision. Additionally, we perform extensive numerical experiments, where the number and density of agents, as well as the number of obstacles, increase. Empirical results show that in complex environments with agents with nonlinear dynamics (e.g., Crazyflie drones), GCBF+ outperforms the hand-crafted CBF-based method with the best performance by up to 20% for relatively small-scale MAS with up to 256 agents, and leading reinforcement learning (RL) methods by up to 40% for MAS with 1024 agents. Furthermore, the proposed method does not compromise on the performance, in terms of goal reaching, for achieving high safety rates, which is a common trade-off in RL-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures; Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |

Despite their versatility, GNNs face significant challenges in transferability, limiting their utility in real-world applications. Existing research in GNN transfer learning overlooks discrepancies in distribution among various graph datasets, facing challenges when transferring across different distributions. How to effectively adopt a well-trained GNN to new graphs with varying feature and structural distributions remains an under-explored problem. Taking inspiration from the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in adapting large language models to various domains, we propose GraphLoRA, an effective and parameter-efficient method for transferring well-trained GNNs to diverse graph domains. Specifically, we first propose a Structure-aware Maximum Mean Discrepancy (SMMD) to align divergent node feature distributions across source and target graphs. Moreover, we introduce low-rank adaptation by injecting a small trainable GNN alongside the pre-trained one, effectively bridging structural distribution gaps while mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, a structure-aware regularization objective is proposed to enhance the adaptability of the pre-trained GNN to target graph with scarce supervision labels. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphLoRA against fourteen baselines by tuning only 20% of parameters, even across disparate graph domains.

We evaluate the effectiveness of a novel GNN-based U-Net architecture on three distinct datasets: PascalVOC, a standard benchmark for natural image segmentation, WoodScape, a challenging dataset of fisheye images commonly used in autonomous driving, introducing significant geometric distortions; and ISIC2016, a dataset of dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation. We compare our proposed UNet-GNN model against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models, including U-Net and U-Net++, as well as the transformer-based SwinUNet. Unlike these methods, which primarily rely on local convolutional operations or global self-attention, GNNs explicitly model relationships between image regions by constructing and operating on a graph representation of the image features. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatial relationships, which we hypothesize will be particularly beneficial for handling geometric distortions present in fisheye imagery and capturing intricate boundaries in medical images. Our analysis demonstrates the versatility of GNNs in addressing diverse segmentation challenges and highlights their potential to improve segmentation accuracy in various applications, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

This is typically due to the controlled training process, or the deployment of untrusted models, such as delegating model training to third-party service, leveraging external training sets, and employing pre-trained models from online sources. Although there's an ongoing increase in research on GNN backdoors, comprehensive investigation into this field is lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose the first survey dedicated to GNN backdoors. We begin by outlining the fundamental definition of GNN, followed by the detailed summarization and categorization of current GNN backdoor attacks and defenses based on their technical characteristics and application scenarios. Subsequently, the analysis of the applicability and use cases of GNN backdoors is undertaken. Finally, the exploration of potential research directions of GNN backdoors is presented. This survey aims to explore the principles of graph backdoors, provide insights to defenders, and promote future security research.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion models have emerged as SOTA approaches in data generation across various modalities. For molecular graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) as a diffusion backbone have achieved impressive results. Latent space diffusion, where diffusion occurs in a low-dimensional space via an autoencoder, has demonstrated computational efficiency. However, the literature on latent space diffusion for molecular graphs is scarce, and no commonly accepted best practices exist. In this work, we explore different approaches and hyperparameters, contrasting generative flow models (denoising diffusion, flow matching, heat dissipation) and architectures (GNNs and E(3)-equivariant GNNs).

However, traditional forecasting methods often model non-Euclidean low-dimensional traffic data as a simple graph with single-type nodes and edges, failing to capture similar trends among nodes of the same type. To address this limitation, this paper proposes MHGNet, a novel framework for modeling spatiotemporal multi-heterogeneous graphs. Within this framework, the STD Module decouples single-pattern traffic data into multi-pattern traffic data through feature mappings of timestamp embedding matrices and node embedding matrices. Subsequently, the Node Clusterer leverages the Euclidean distance between nodes and different types of limit points to perform clustering with O(N) time complexity. The nodes within each cluster undergo residual subgraph convolution within the spatiotemporal fusion subgraphs generated by the DSTGG Module, followed by processing in the SIE Module for node repositioning and redistribution of weights. To validate the effectiveness of MHGNet, this paper conducts extensive ablation studies and quantitative evaluations on four widely used benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 lEEE International Conference on Acoustics, speech, and signal Processing (lCASSP2025)</p></details> |
| **[CONTINUUM: Detecting APT Attacks through Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02981v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their sophisticated and stealthy nature. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) often fall short in detecting these multi-stage attacks. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been employed to enhance IDS capabilities by analyzing the complex relationships within networked data. However, existing GNN-based solutions are hampered by high false positive rates and substantial resource consumption. In this paper, we present a novel IDS designed to detect APTs using a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Autoencoder. Our approach leverages spatial information to understand the interactions between entities within a graph and temporal information to capture the evolution of the graph over time. This dual perspective is crucial for identifying the sequential stages of APTs. Furthermore, to address privacy and scalability concerns, we deploy our architecture in a federated learning environment. This setup ensures that local data remains on-premise while encrypted model-weights are shared and aggregated using homomorphic encryption, maintaining data privacy and security. Our evaluation shows that this system effectively detects APTs with lower false positive rates and optimized resource usage compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of spatio-temporal analysis and federated learning in enhancing cybersecurity defenses.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[LightGNN: Simple Graph Neural Network for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03228v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in collaborative recommendation through their ability to conduct high-order representation smoothing, effectively capturing structural information within users' interaction patterns. However, existing GNN paradigms face significant challenges in scalability and robustness when handling large-scale, noisy, and real-world datasets. To address these challenges, we present LightGNN, a lightweight and distillation-based GNN pruning framework designed to substantially reduce model complexity while preserving essential collaboration modeling capabilities. Our LightGNN framework introduces a computationally efficient pruning module that adaptively identifies and removes redundant edges and embedding entries for model compression. The framework is guided by a resource-friendly hierarchical knowledge distillation objective, whose intermediate layer augments the observed graph to maintain performance, particularly in high-rate compression scenarios. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate LightGNN's effectiveness, significantly improving both computational efficiency and recommendation accuracy. Notably, LightGNN achieves an 80% reduction in edge count and 90% reduction in embedding entries while maintaining performance comparable to more complex state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of our LightGNN framework is available at the github repository: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WSDM 2025 Oral</p></details> |
| **[Graph Learning for Numeric Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24080v2)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning is naturally well suited for use in symbolic, object-centric planning due to its ability to exploit relational structures exhibited in planning domains and to take as input planning instances with arbitrary numbers of objects. Numeric planning is an extension of symbolic planning in which states may now also exhibit numeric variables. In this work, we propose data-efficient and interpretable machine learning models for learning to solve numeric planning tasks. This involves constructing a new graph kernel for graphs with both continuous and categorical attributes, as well as new optimisation methods for learning heuristic functions for numeric planning. Experiments show that our graph kernels are vastly more efficient and generalise better than graph neural networks for numeric planning, and also yield competitive coverage performance compared to domain-independent numeric planners.

| **[Optimizing Supply Chain Networks with the Power of Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06221v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as transformative tools for modeling complex relational data, offering unprecedented capabilities in tasks like forecasting and optimization. This study investigates the application of GNNs to demand forecasting within supply chain networks using the SupplyGraph dataset, a benchmark for graph-based supply chain analysis. By leveraging advanced GNN methodologies, we enhance the accuracy of forecasting models, uncover latent dependencies, and address temporal complexities inherent in supply chain operations. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GNN-based models significantly outperform traditional approaches, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), particularly in single-node demand forecasting tasks. The integration of graph representation learning with temporal data highlights GNNs' potential to revolutionize predictive capabilities for inventory management, production scheduling, and logistics optimization. This work underscores the pivotal role of forecasting in supply chain management and provides a robust framework for advancing research and applications in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[LHGNN: Local-Higher Order Graph Neural Networks For Audio Classification and Tagging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03464v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have set new benchmarks in audio processing tasks, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture complex patterns and dependencies within audio data. However, their focus on pairwise interactions limits their ability to process the higher-order relations essential for identifying distinct audio objects. To address this limitation, this work introduces the Local- Higher Order Graph Neural Network (LHGNN), a graph based model that enhances feature understanding by integrating local neighbourhood information with higher-order data from Fuzzy C-Means clusters, thereby capturing a broader spectrum of audio relationships. Evaluation of the model on three publicly available audio datasets shows that it outperforms Transformer-based models across all benchmarks while operating with substantially fewer parameters. Moreover, LHGNN demonstrates a distinct advantage in scenarios lacking ImageNet pretraining, establishing its effectiveness and efficiency in environments where extensive pretraining data is unavailable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Efficiency and Expressiveness: Subgraph GNNs with Walk-Based Centrality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03113v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an expressive and efficient approach that combines the strengths of two prominent extensions of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Subgraph GNNs and Structural Encodings (SEs). Our approach leverages walk-based centrality measures, both as a powerful form of SE and also as a subgraph selection strategy for Subgraph GNNs. By drawing a connection to perturbation analysis, we highlight the effectiveness of centrality-based sampling, and show it significantly reduces the computational burden associated with Subgraph GNNs. Further, we combine our efficient Subgraph GNN with SEs derived from the calculated centrality and demonstrate this hybrid approach, dubbed HyMN, gains in discriminative power. HyMN effectively addresses the expressiveness limitations of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) while mitigating the computational costs of Subgraph GNNs. Through a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks, we show it outperforms other subgraph sampling approaches while being competitive with full-bag Subgraph GNNs and other state-of-the-art approaches with a notably reduced runtime.</p></details> | 33 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Conservation-informed Graph Learning for Spatiotemporal Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20962v3)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-centric methods have shown great potential in understanding and predicting spatiotemporal dynamics, enabling better design and control of the object system. However, deep learning models often lack interpretability, fail to obey intrinsic physics, and struggle to cope with the various domains. While geometry-based methods, e.g., graph neural networks (GNNs), have been proposed to further tackle these challenges, they still need to find the implicit physical laws from large datasets and rely excessively on rich labeled data. In this paper, we herein introduce the conservation-informed GNN (CiGNN), an end-to-end explainable learning framework, to learn spatiotemporal dynamics based on limited training data. The network is designed to conform to the general conservation law via symmetry, where conservative and non-conservative information passes over a multiscale space enhanced by a latent temporal marching strategy. The efficacy of our model has been verified in various spatiotemporal systems based on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superiority over baseline models. Results demonstrate that CiGNN exhibits remarkable accuracy and generalizability, and is readily applicable to learning for prediction of various spatiotemporal dynamics in a spatial domain with complex geometry.</p></details> |  |
